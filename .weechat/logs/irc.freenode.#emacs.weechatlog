2017-02-28 22:30:07	benaiah	that'd be way better if you could define pagebreaks well in browsers
2017-02-28 22:30:27	benaiah	e1f: if it was in CSS that wouldn't work, those sites need you to make another request so you load new ads
2017-02-28 22:30:36	twb	benaiah: you mean you want to force a continuous media browser to act like a paged media browser?
2017-02-28 22:30:58	twb	benaiah: because paged browsers already have CSS rules to govern layout (e.g. page-break-inside: avoid, as mentioned already)
2017-02-28 22:31:43	benaiah	twb: people put slides on the web. those are paged, by definition. I'd much prefer that they could be done in the browser using CSS (as previously mentioned, page-based properties don't work in browsers) instead of some hacky JS solution

2017-03-01 00:49:32	benaiah	or just write a little elisp wrapper to do the exact behavior

2017-03-01 03:12:37	triplc	can i define keybinding with AltGr key, which is different from nornal Atl key?
2017-03-01 03:12:51	twrk	you're using xterm or straight bash?
2017-03-01 03:13:31	twrk	i googled a solution to that and it was 'use setkeybd to a layout that maps alt and altgr to the same key'
2017-03-01 03:13:47	twrk	using showkey to find out the #
2017-03-01 03:13:53	twrk	or something like that
2017-03-01 03:14:25	twrk	but alt is meta
2017-03-01 03:14:43	twrk	so if you were in X , idk if it differentiates between alt and altgr
2017-03-01 03:15:07	triplc	yeah, alt is meta, but i think it's good if i can use 2 alt with 2 meaning
2017-03-01 03:15:18	triplc	not both with the same meaning as Meta
2017-03-01 03:16:02	triplc	currently i can set the left control key as hyper key, and right control as normal control

2017-03-09 22:48:58	catern	the reason I ask is that it occurred to me that lots of different languages can be embedded into larger C programs. so a thing you could do is, write several programs in several languages, let them communicate with IPC, and then link them into a single operating system process and provide your own implementations of socket/pipe/open/read/write/etc., which just do memory reads and writes (when possible) instead of going out to the kernel

2017-03-09 22:58:11	myrkraverk	or am I misunderstanding something?
2017-03-09 22:58:15	catern	myrkraverk: yeah, but the typical C program has a main function and global variables
2017-03-09 22:58:51	myrkraverk	well, depending on the program, you /might/ still be able to dlopen() it.
2017-03-09 22:58:54	homerj	C doesn't a runtime and isn't afraid of anything
2017-03-09 22:59:03	amosbird	hi, how can I quickly show a package's version?
2017-03-09 22:59:03	catern	maybe I don't really know much about C... but my guess would be that that makes it really tricky to run multiple C programs in the same process
2017-03-09 22:59:22	catern	myrkraverk: what part would depend on the program?
2017-03-09 22:59:26	myrkraverk	catern: probably -- and you'll have to link each program as a shared library on most systems.
2017-03-09 23:00:01	catern	myrkraverk: not sure what you mean by "link each program as a shared library", do you mean I can't link them statically?
2017-03-09 23:00:17	catern	hmm
2017-03-09 23:00:21	catern	let me rephrase I guess
2017-03-09 23:00:34	myrkraverk	catern: assuming you can link it as a shared library and dlopen() it, the globals might be separate (or not, it depends on many things, including the OS) -- then you might be able to run it if it doesn't fork().
2017-03-09 23:00:53	catern	C programs don't have a well-known event loop that you can call into, while languages that have a runtime (Java, Python) do have an event loop that you can call into and pump
2017-03-09 23:01:00	myrkraverk	catern: ELFs are usually linked as shared objects, or executably programs -- no both.
2017-03-09 23:01:08	catern	so you can have multiple of those languages in the same process "easily"
2017-03-09 23:01:47	catern	but to have multiple C programs in the same process would require implementing preemption
2017-03-09 23:02:00	catern	not exactly a fun prospect

2017-03-09 23:03:44	myrkraverk	catern: for a C program, you'd typically have to have enough of the source to re-link it as shared object. (.so file, or .dylib, or .dll, or .whatever).

2017-03-09 23:24:29	homerj	yeah, I mean, for me it's not an "either or" it's just an additional thing
2017-03-09 23:24:34	homerj	sometimes I get an ebook, sometimes not
2017-03-09 23:24:43	myrkraverk	I should write about the problems of typesetting (automatically) code.
2017-03-09 23:25:03	codingquark	I bought physical copy of 1984 because I know that book is excellent and I would share it with many around me.

2017-03-09 23:27:37	codingquark	We need floss eReader
2017-03-09 23:27:42	myrkraverk	floss?
2017-03-09 23:27:42	fsbot	hmm, FLOSS is [0] short for Free / Libre / Open Source Software

2017-03-09 23:29:18	codingquark	No cost why?
2017-03-09 23:29:31	myrkraverk	codingquark: you can download FBreader to any android device.
2017-03-09 23:29:32	codingquark	It's a device like a car, or a door of my room

2017-03-10 06:24:53	juboba	thanks phoe_
2017-03-10 06:24:55	phoe_	Generally - font-lock-mode is what allows you to have syntax highlighting, including different font faces/colors/other traits for function names and variables that you can define with regular expressions.
2017-03-10 06:25:52	phoe_	And an interesting debugger for this mode is font-lock-studio. Not the simplest to use (at least for me), but it helped me a few times when I wanted to debug a few custom locks.

2017-03-10 15:00:24	lemonpie	well, yeah, there is, overlays would make it fairly easy to do
2017-03-10 15:00:33	wasamasa	it's not crazy at all, you can use M-x highlight-phrase already for marking up a specific phrase
2017-03-10 15:00:43	wasamasa	the hard part is making it automatic so that it works on text you type
2017-03-10 15:00:49	foozb12	I'm not familiar with overlays
2017-03-10 15:00:59	lemonpie	i'd want it to avoid using colours used for syntax highlighting, myself

2017-03-10 15:08:03	foozb12	Seems like I can just code up something to highlight next change and make it a random color

Either you make a stream-promise which is not a promise, in which case you must also make STREAM-DELAY, STREAM-FORCE, and STREAM-LAZY, which fail to compose with any existing laziness operations; or you require STREAM-FILTER to be more eager than necessary (e.g., with odd streams instead of even streams), which is error-prone and leads to more complicated code.

2017-03-11 14:00:01	bremner	using "return" seems to be needed?

2017-03-11 14:01:18	Seylerius	Shouldn't be. Result mode should default to value, meaning that the results block is set to the value of the last expression.

2017-03-11 15:17:08	wasamasa	keep in mind that doing that may have other side effects, such as forcing a redisplay which takes time
2017-03-11 15:17:20	wasamasa	especially if you're doing this with a cc-derived mode
2017-03-11 15:17:40	ideasman42	redisplay wont be slow, calculating this takes ~1second

2017-03-11 15:47:58	wasamasa	that's because redisplay takes ages
