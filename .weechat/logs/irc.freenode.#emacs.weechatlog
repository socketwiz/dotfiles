2017-09-19 19:57:30	socketwiz	I'm using emacs 24.5.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.3 and for some reason the command "package-autoremove" seems to be missing.  Any idea why that would be? I thought that command was built into emacs or am I mistaken?

2017-09-19 21:19:33	catern	I can do that with tmux, and maybe hack it some to allow me to attach/detach emacs, but maybe there's a better way?
2017-09-19 21:22:00	defanor	catern: one way is to run the process with named pipes attached to stdin/stdout/stderr, then connect the fake python to those. or work directly with /proc/<pid>/fd/{1,2,3}

2017-09-19 21:32:06	twb	As much as I distrust the hype behind rust, I think I have to hate C++ and anything written in it MORE.
2017-09-19 21:32:39	twb	And that especially includes large C++ codebases initially written by an ISP as a loss-leader for dialup subscriptions

2017-09-19 21:32:45	aidalgol	An FF fork, that also forked Gecko.
2017-09-19 21:33:14	twb	Ah no palemoon is the one that keeps XUL around instead of switching to the common plugin framework for chrome/ie/opera/firefox
2017-09-19 21:33:42	hodapp	mlehhhh, C++
2017-09-19 21:33:47	aidalgol	Yes.
2017-09-19 21:33:56	twb	The arguments against XUL are pretty compelling --- it relies on making calls directly to deep innards inside the gecko engine
2017-09-19 21:33:57	hodapp	I've warmed up to it a little after hating it passionately when I had to work with it every day (and with Visual Studio)

2017-09-19 21:34:57	twb	aidalgol: and AIUI you can call *arbitrary* things inside the engine
2017-09-19 21:34:59	aidalgol	So what I liked about it was a horrible design aspect.
2017-09-19 21:35:00	hodapp	aidalgol: the amount of cargo-culting that passes as 'normal' there is appalling, but is pretty part for the course.

2017-09-19 21:35:15	twb	aidalgol: which means that plugin authors just discover a neat function and start calling it

2017-09-20 01:29:12	jkamat	add-to-list dosen't add if the thing already exists, which I wanted to keep
2017-09-20 01:29:40	twb	right, add-to-list is idempotent and it will setq wich append requires explicitly
2017-09-20 01:29:55	codingquark	I didn't pay much attention to it, but I think it is worth noticing. When my laptop is shutdown, the battery still gets used. If I keep it shutdown for ~8 hours, the battery goes from 100% to ~85%. Why would this be happening?

2017-09-20 10:59:03	ideasman42	infact rust is pretty awesome, have been maintaining C code for 10 years, so I dont mind some inconvenience to avoid creepy bugs
2017-09-20 10:59:15	tromey	anyway, rust does require some thought about the ownership

2017-09-20 16:49:48	JordiGH	Client asks, ok, how do I download this to Excel.

2017-09-20 16:50:09	Sketch	they might want to do something with the data other than just look at it?
2017-09-20 16:50:27	Sketch	though in that case all the website needs to do is provide a csv for download
2017-09-20 16:50:30	wasamasa	https://gist.github.com/kuwze/121e093e8535756226661dc5061760fd#file-mode-compile-el-L289-L294
2017-09-20 16:50:34	JordiGH	Sketch: "all"
2017-09-20 16:50:47	wasamasa	kuwze: lesson's learned: don't put dodgy elisp into your load-path
2017-09-20 16:50:52	Sketch	then they can import it in whatever they want
2017-09-20 16:50:58	JordiGH	Sketch: The data in this case is just a list of offices and how close each office is to completion.
2017-09-20 16:51:11	wasamasa	kuwze: the last thing it's been tested on is emacs 19.31 ffs
2017-09-20 16:51:11	JordiGH	I can't possibly imagine what would they want to do with it other than knowing how far along each office is.
2017-09-20 16:51:47	kuwze	wasamasa: thanks for helping me debug this issue
2017-09-20 16:51:53	JordiGH	But still, the maxim still holds: all data is born and dies in Excel. At all endpoints and various midpoints of the data lifecycle, Excel is there.

2017-09-20 21:33:48	hodapp	mrm: There is still a practical distinction here of whether or not a DSL should be embedded within Lisp (and have at its disposal much of the respective Lisp), or whether it should sit separate (and, perhaps purposefully, eschew the extra expressiveness there and have a more limited format).

2017-09-20 21:34:20	mrm	If you can use a reader macro to implement an alternate configuration notation, why not something that implements /bin/cat ? It seems weird to just claim the latter is not a part of a lisp with reader macros while the former is.

2017-09-20 21:39:03	mrm	Because the point of a DSL fundamentally is to let you represent things however you want for some small trivial purpose. If you're imposing a restriction on what DSLs can or cannot do, you're making an assertion that applies to every weird corner case. DSLs are more or less all corner cases.
2017-09-20 21:39:36	hemite	well you can probably tell terminal emacs to start the x server which will then start gui emacs

2017-09-20 21:48:41	hodapp	that the needs of the language, and its usage, inform whether it might be more sensible to embed it into another language (sometimes one that's already in use, sometimes one that just happens to be handy), or whether to keep it separate
2017-09-20 21:49:24	mrm	Whether either DSL is embedded in the language or implemented through a separate processing step is pretty irrelevant.

2017-09-20 21:51:14	hodapp	if it is a requirement that the DSL *not* be able to use certain abstractions (which is often the case for languages kept purposely very compact and limited), it may influence whether embedding is even an option

2017-09-21 00:54:54	igemnace	codingquark: the proof doesn't involve "using" up the natural numbers; it assumes that you *have* established a one-to-one correspondence
2017-09-21 00:55:31	igemnace	then goes to show that there is a well-defined way to come up with a number that does *not* appear in that one-to-one correspondence, but is a real number

2017-09-21 00:56:01	igemnace	yep
2017-09-21 00:56:03	codingquark	Exactly.
2017-09-21 00:56:46	codingquark	If a number did not appear in natural numbers and real numbers, we can add +1 to naturals and get the one-to-one correspondence.

2017-09-21 00:59:31	codingquark	Can one say that infinite natural numbers end? Let's say no. Then, how can we say that it has some size? The size is infinite. The same way, the size of real numbers is infinite. ∞ > ∞ ?
2017-09-21 01:00:03	parsnip	codingquark: maybe this comes down to knowing definition of bijection.
2017-09-21 01:00:16	parsnip	we could reduce our statements to that.
2017-09-21 01:00:21	igemnace	that's a very good question. jumping from "it's infinite" to "it has some size" is actually an axiom, of sorts
2017-09-21 01:00:59	parsnip	i don't think i fully parsed the question yet
2017-09-21 01:01:04	igemnace	all of cantor's ramblings on transfinites rely on "let's say there *is* some size to an infinite set. what can we find out about the nature of this size?"
2017-09-21 01:01:36	codingquark	Ah! There it is then.
2017-09-21 01:01:39	parsnip	there's an injection from naturals to reals, but not a surjection.
2017-09-21 01:01:53	parsnip	thus, they are fewer.

2017-09-21 01:02:30	codingquark	For something to be smaller, it needs size.

2017-09-21 01:04:06	codingquark	igemnace: when you said Cantor relied on sizes of infinite sets, I could understand a few things..
2017-09-21 01:04:38	codingquark	parsnip: does that hold true for infinitely many naturals and reals?
2017-09-21 01:04:46	parsnip	yes
2017-09-21 01:04:50	igemnace	codingquark: yup. not exactly "relied" as in "i believe this is true" btw
2017-09-21 01:05:14	igemnace	codingquark: more like, "if this is true, what can else we infer from it?"
2017-09-21 01:05:32	parsnip	the definition of ijnective and surjective is _very_ simple
2017-09-21 01:05:37	parsnip	*injective
2017-09-21 01:05:51	codingquark	igemnace: right, I understand.
2017-09-21 01:06:30	igemnace	codingquark: what you also have to consider is that we're side-stepping the "infinite" part of things. and we do that actually because we can't figure out how "infinite" works by intuition
2017-09-21 01:06:31	parsnip	injective and surjective is like one of the first things you learn after picking math as a major.
2017-09-21 01:07:04	igemnace	codingquark: natural numbers, real numbers, think of them first and foremost as sets. they *are* sets, aren't they?
2017-09-21 01:07:45	igemnace	codingquark: we can work with sets. we can't work with "infinite" yet, but if we look to the "set" nature of these numbers, let's hope we understand enough to work with "infinite" later on
2017-09-21 01:08:17	igemnace	codingquark: that's why we work with bijection and cardinality with transfinites
2017-09-21 01:08:53	parsnip	i think you can define finite as, there is some N such that there is a surjection.
2017-09-21 01:09:23	codingquark	How about infinite, then?
2017-09-21 01:09:39	codingquark	igemnace says we don't really know how to do that...
2017-09-21 01:09:52	parsnip	there is no N such that there is a surjection
2017-09-21 01:10:10	parsnip	just the negation
2017-09-21 01:10:27	igemnace	codingquark: we do. my "we don't know how to do that" is more of a narrative description of how the theory on transfinites proceeds
2017-09-21 01:10:29	parsnip	you keep picking N, still no surjection
2017-09-21 01:10:36	codingquark	parsnip: re for every natural, there...: How can we accept this for infinite?
2017-09-21 01:10:56	parsnip	how can we accept? i don't understand the question.
2017-09-21 01:11:08	codingquark	How is that possible for infinite numbers?
2017-09-21 01:11:31	parsnip	there's no surjection from a finite set onto the naturals, for example.

2017-09-21 01:15:51	parsnip	okay, and can we agree that a set  A is smaller than a set B if there is an injection from A to B but no surjection?
2017-09-21 01:16:14	igemnace	but what you have to remember is that the process of getting that new number (the diagonalization) relies on the assumption that there is *already* a one-to-one correspondence
2017-09-21 01:16:21	codingquark	igemnace: seems I've been tricked that way.
2017-09-21 01:16:36	codingquark	parsnip: for finite sets, yes :P
2017-09-21 01:16:47	parsnip	codingquark: why not for infinite sets?
2017-09-21 01:16:55	igemnace	how can a process, that relies on an assumption, lead to a result that contradicts the very assumption that allowed it to happen in the first place?
2017-09-21 01:17:24	igemnace	there must be something wrong with either the process or the assumption
2017-09-21 01:17:38	codingquark	igemnace: this is making sense now...
2017-09-21 01:17:38	parsnip	codingquark: option b, let's _define_ smaller for infinite sets, in this injective/surjective manner.
2017-09-21 01:18:06	codingquark	parsnip: okay...
2017-09-21 01:18:16	codingquark	Define...
2017-09-21 01:18:49	parsnip	define it now? or did you understand my definition previously?
2017-09-21 01:19:06	codingquark	parsnip: I thought you're going to define something new :P
2017-09-21 01:19:16	parsnip	22:15 <parsnip> okay, and can we agree that a set  A is smaller than a set B if there is an injection from A to B but no surjection?
2017-09-21 01:19:22	parsnip	that is my definition ^
2017-09-21 01:19:46	parsnip	can we assume that now?
2017-09-21 01:19:53	parsnip	"for argument sake"
2017-09-21 01:20:26	parsnip	if so, i think i like what igemnace is working on on the other side, i might rephrase a tiny bit.
2017-09-21 01:20:43	codingquark	igemnace: I thought of two things when you said "...relies on the assumption that...". 1. That assumption has to be wrong. 2. The process has to be wrong. I'm thinking we cannot talk about surjection and injection for infinite sets, since I _feel_ we need to assume there is a measurable size for the sets.
2017-09-21 01:21:17	parsnip	sounds like you are having problems with many pieces of this argument
2017-09-21 01:21:19	codingquark	parsnip: we can assume that.
2017-09-21 01:21:47	parsnip	1. size vs inj/surj, 2. how proof by contradiction works
2017-09-21 01:22:07	igemnace	codingquark: (1) yep (2) yep. re: surjection and injection, your feeling is right, but your thinking is wrong! there's nothing stopping us from assuming there is a measurable size, actually
2017-09-21 01:22:10	twb	Let's introduce proof by constriction
2017-09-21 01:22:28	parsnip	proof by intimidation
2017-09-21 01:22:41	codingquark	:'D No intimidation!
2017-09-21 01:22:43	igemnace	plus without that assumption, we can't actually deduce anything of importance about infinite sets!
2017-09-21 01:22:44	twb	Very imflammable dese lemmas
2017-09-21 01:22:50	codingquark	Not possible to intimidate sets.

2017-09-21 01:25:36	igemnace	yup! that's why the theory on transfinites is a bit of a divisive topic among some mathematicians
2017-09-21 01:25:57	igemnace	it's very easy for some to accept that assumption (it's a set. how can it not have a measurable size?)

2017-09-21 05:34:48	neuro_sys	johnnymacs: It's something I'm trying to write myself: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html
2017-09-21 05:35:27	neuro_sys	Basically I want per-project settings, and found about .dir-locals.el file that is by default read by emacs
2017-09-21 05:35:51	johnnymacs	Generally this is something you want to put in your .emacs not by editing a standard file

2017-09-21 11:24:28	hodapp	but a lot of pop-science articles don't really distinguish "artificial intelligence" from "artificial general intelligence"

2017-09-21 11:25:24	hodapp	neither are Wired articles that try to spin every single AI result and non-result as teetering on the edge of SkyNet
2017-09-21 11:25:34	JordiGH	It keeps happening that as soon as we solve some AI problem and the solution ends up being "just search the whole damn solution space, with some minor pruning" we think, oh... well, that wasn't very clever.
2017-09-21 11:25:40	JordiGH	So it's no longer AI.
2017-09-21 11:26:35	hodapp	imaginary AI has a way of being a lot more exciting than actual AI.
2017-09-21 11:27:28	hodapp	but yes, a whole lot of AI is just finding more efficient methods of searching, clever tricks to reduce the search space, and heuristics that are more effective.
2017-09-21 11:27:51	hodapp	rudybot: or in your case, less effective.
2017-09-21 11:27:56	rudybot	hodapp: aiui it's most famous for "bursty" jobs where load is going to be highly variable, and is a less effective choice for constant low levels of load (like forcer's case of running an emacs irc client forever) :)

2017-09-21 11:28:45	hodapp	technomancy: I remember at the age of 7 or 8 reading a book on robotics that changed my view a little bit, because it pointed out numerous examples of (at the time) contemporary robots and it really laid out the limitations

2017-09-21 11:29:30	JordiGH	It's a series of conveyer belts that talk to each other and carefully move books around.
2017-09-21 11:29:36	hodapp	it had a case study of a guy who was confined to a wheelchair and had a voice-operated system, and made it very clear that this system responded to very specific commands and if the guy reworded anything or even added "please" to a command it wouldn't work right.

2017-09-21 12:59:08	defanor	btw, i tend to reduce the amount of markup with time – getting closer to just text. i guess that's one of the things that bother me with markup languages: lots of unnecessary stuff that just complicates those and makes them harder to convert to other formats. but at the same time, plenty of features, like sections, lists, tables, etc, are quite useful

If that does not attract the person's attention, it's the ad's fault, or so the reasoning is. You generally pay per impression. The next step is "click" and then "conversion" (converting someone from just clicking to following through with whatever the ad's intention was, usually looking at some website for online marketing).

2017-09-21 15:52:29	wasamasa	arun_t: I'm not sure how good of an idea this is considering that you need someone to keep that list up to date and reel in people who'd actually do something about that list
2017-09-21 15:52:55	wasamasa	arun_t: whereas someone who finds issues and studies them on their own has a good chance of figuring out how difficult they are for them
2017-09-21 15:53:09	forcer	arun_t: I heard that suggestion before. It's really tricky, though. If I spend enough time on an issue to figure out if it's "easy" (and "easy" depends a *lot* on the background of that person), I probably could have done it myself. I would love to help people make it easier to contribute, but I did not feel that particular thing was a good use of my time.

2017-09-22 02:40:21	ixxie	I think you linked the smaller format though
2017-09-22 02:40:25	ixxie	I use the standard size
2017-09-22 02:40:33	gmcastil	ixxie: yeah i use the 3.5x5.5 as my daily driver
2017-09-22 02:40:48	codingquark	3.5x5.5 is a nice tiny size TBH
2017-09-22 02:41:11	ixxie	I often like to draw diagrams so I need the bigger format

2017-09-22 02:45:07	codingquark	I've heard good things about Pelikan.
2017-09-22 02:45:08	hmw	So there are cheap pens, that are useful.
2017-09-22 02:45:09	gmcastil	when i need more space, i usually use printer paper or a whiteboard (or often, just the back of a schematic)
2017-09-22 02:45:23	gmcastil	hmw: yeah, the uniball non-gell pen i linked earlier is an example of that
2017-09-22 02:46:26	hmw	codingquark: Yepp, genrally speaking they are good writers. Sometimes the nib is overpolished, which IMO is a shame, especially on the higher priced pens.

2017-09-22 02:51:06	gmcastil	hmw: yeah, my subjective experience has been that it is a function of time and use - i've never used one of those pens until dry.  they've always leaked on me at some point
2017-09-22 02:51:11	gmcastil	YMMV
2017-09-22 02:51:16	hmw	codingquark: I never owned a Safari (yet ;)). But I used one and they seem to be good value for the money. I think about getting one in the matte black finish.
2017-09-22 02:51:50	codingquark	hmw: matte black looks great in pics at least. I am searching if it comes with fine nib.
2017-09-22 02:52:23	codingquark	OTOH, I like the looks of a few waterman pens, but I cannot use them.
2017-09-22 02:52:33	codingquark	Local stores do not keep such fancy pens :(
2017-09-22 02:52:39	hmw	gmcastil: I don't know, but it looks like the parts of the pen are hold together by friction fit. I have the feeling that that is part of the problem.
2017-09-22 02:52:54	gmcastil	hmw: yes, it leaks at the junction between the upper and lower parts
2017-09-22 02:52:56	codingquark	Okay, Safari has fine nib version.
2017-09-22 02:53:38	hmw	codingquark: I like medium or bold nibs ;). It's not the best for writing whole pages, but I like the feeling of the bold nib ;).

2017-09-22 02:54:44	hmw	One can get the black coloured nib for the Safaries. With some body colours that looks really good.

2017-09-22 03:24:55	twb	I mean maybe it'll dissolve their insulating oils
2017-09-22 03:25:02	twb	it won't dissolve a whole duck
2017-09-22 03:25:19	twb	you'd need a peroxide or sulfide
2017-09-22 03:25:19	gmcastil	well, given a sufficiently large volume of acetone, proper pH, and a very long time it would...
2017-09-22 03:25:29	hmw	gmcastil: For getting rid of the ink that might work better than water. But the pen itself is often made from delicate materials. I guess most of them don't like acetone or alcohol ;).

2017-09-22 20:46:24	ealfonso	why is there a debian-file->string? why isn't this part of emacs?
2017-09-22 20:47:01	ecbrown	baxx: first step is to try both machines with vanilla emacs, i.e. emacs -Q
2017-09-22 20:47:19	ecbrown	,-Q
2017-09-22 20:47:19	fsbot	I heard -q is [0]  runs emacs without user configuration, ideal to test issues caused by your personal config
2017-09-22 20:47:19	fsbot	[1] If starting emacs with "emacs -q" fixes the problem, it's YOUR FAULT; check your .emacs. If "emacs -q" has problems but "emacs -Q" doesn't, blame your distro or local admin.
2017-09-22 20:47:19	fsbot	[2] it's also possible that you have triggered a bug rather than introduced one, but that is rare.

2017-09-22 21:01:24	ealfonso	edgar-rft say you have a library which needs to read some data from a filename for internal purposes. then you would need to implement debian-file->string unless you want to leave random emacs buffers with underlying files hanging around to the user
2017-09-22 21:02:12	ealfonso	edgar-rft and even if you don't care about that, you'd still need more than one sexp to achieve the task

2017-09-23 16:02:45	Tekk_	Because your first question when you see a bug report now has to be "Did the user's distro 'fix' something and cause this breakage?"

2017-09-23 20:12:55	ealfonso	erisco show me your make-process example
2017-09-23 20:13:04	drduck	I'd like for it to just launch into rxjs-mode by default.

2017-09-23 20:15:24	ealfonso	erisco you can also access that in emacs, via C-h f make-pipe-process. in both places you will not find any :command argument to make-pipe-process
2017-09-23 20:15:24	Tekk_	.jsx is irrelevant

2017-09-23 20:17:36	drduck	Tekk_: So do you think it should look like the following? (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.js\\'" . rjsx-mode))
2017-09-23 20:18:00	Tekk_	drduck: I can never remember emacs syntax regexps, I think it has to be *\\.js though
2017-09-23 20:18:04	Tekk_	or .*\\.js
2017-09-23 20:18:19	ealfonso	erisco no need to guess, what does the doc for the :command argument say?
2017-09-23 20:18:25	erisco	ealfonso, it concerns me that error_buffer is nil… suggests to me that letrec doesn't put error_buffer in scope
2017-09-23 20:18:38	erisco	so I have also tried  :buffer "foo.txt"  instead of using output_buffer, but no change
2017-09-23 20:18:39	parsnip	drduck: you can check C-h v auto-mode-alist to get a quick overview of _all_ of them as examples.

2017-09-23 20:19:36	erisco	ealfonso, I have never written Lisp before, so maybe there is something technical in the doc for :command that I do not recognise
2017-09-23 20:20:07	ealfonso	:command COMMAND -- COMMAND is a list starting with the program file name, followed by strings to give to the program as arguments.

2017-09-23 20:20:40	erisco	yes, I have read it numerous times
2017-09-23 20:20:46	ealfonso	you have a string, not a list
2017-09-23 20:20:57	ealfonso	change that to '("your-command")
2017-09-23 20:21:14	erisco	okay, thanks, I was not aware
2017-09-23 20:21:22	erisco	I thought just listing things was a list
2017-09-23 20:21:33	erisco	and I thought '(...) was a symbol

2017-09-23 20:22:45	iqubic	erisco: in Haskell a string is a list of chars. In lisp a list is anything with parens on either side. Also, every list in lisp is heterogeneous by nature of the language.
2017-09-23 20:22:49	ealfonso	erisco you can use (list "your-command" "arg1" ...)
2017-09-23 20:23:42	iqubic	That list function creates a list. It is also variadic.

2017-09-23 20:30:19	erisco	iqubic, I will get around to it eventually once I have a reason to Emacs, which will be to test this module :)
2017-09-23 20:30:39	iqubic	What module are you testing at the moment?
2017-09-23 20:30:41	erisco	but maybe I should learn this doc command, thingie

2017-09-23 21:01:08	erisco	I would prefer a long running process where multiple messages will be exchanged over a pipe. However, Emacs is rather tardy with checking for new output from the child process… I have not figured out or found any other mechanism to change this
2017-09-23 21:01:26	erisco	there is a function to block in wait for output, but that is undesirable
2017-09-23 21:01:53	erisco	if that is my only option then I will instead figure out how to use short-lived processes

2017-09-23 21:06:20	erisco	then the result is to be sent back to Emacs and displayed in some manner
2017-09-23 21:07:18	erisco	the return trip is the issue at the moment because Emacs does not regularly (enough) poll the pipe to see if there is anything to be read

2017-09-23 21:07:46	erisco	for example, I wrote a process which emits one message per second, for 10 seconds, and it isn't until the process ends after 10 seconds that I see any of the emitted messages in my Emacs buffer
2017-09-23 21:08:37	erisco	if that is the best that can be done, then I need to change my approach to use one process per communication
2017-09-23 21:08:53	erisco	since the death of a process does signal Emacs to check the pipe

2017-09-23 21:53:06	jkamat	the cygwin port is super slow for some reason (and the windows veresion is slow too, something about fork being slower on windows)
2017-09-23 21:53:25	sanitypassing	well I'm normally on Linux and am currently on Windows for school stuff, so I'm trying to avoid a VM
2017-09-23 21:53:29	jkamat	the WSL emacs works, but has no X (and the hack I found online had terrible font support) so I thought it really sucked
2017-09-23 21:54:07	jkamat	sanitypassing: I would reccomend windows binaries then :)
2017-09-23 21:54:16	sanitypassing	hmm, okay
2017-09-23 21:54:36	sanitypassing	thanks!
2017-09-23 21:54:40	Lis	sanitypassing, easiest but uggly: gnuwin32 + emacs official, more advances find plugins/script for the function you need + emacs official. third compile everything on your own.
2017-09-23 21:55:25	Lis	but the official packages do not have anything missing. only if the underlying os doesnt support it.

2017-09-24 02:49:01	Tekk_	Not exactly
2017-09-24 02:50:01	Tekk_	I mean that's the most common way to do the injection, but what the author is arguing is "why is this vulnerability possible in the first place when you're doing something so obvious as concating the strings together?"
2017-09-24 02:50:26	wasamasa	it's because a string is a poor representation here
2017-09-24 02:50:31	Tekk_	(at least partially by separating the "code" and the "data", which is what prepared statements are for)
2017-09-24 02:50:32	Tekk_	Yep
2017-09-24 02:50:34	tamouse__	you're both in violent agreement
2017-09-24 02:50:52	wasamasa	you should ideally accept trees and quote data

2017-09-24 02:51:01	tamouse__	:)
2017-09-24 02:51:08	wasamasa	length has absolutely nothing to do with it and just confuses others
2017-09-24 02:51:37	tamouse__	another way to put it: never accept untainted user input into your code
2017-09-24 02:52:02	Tekk_	Well that's what perl's for
2017-09-24 02:52:46	tamouse__	another way to put it: guard your boundaries closely
2017-09-24 02:53:45	tamouse__	haha, right, Tekk_
2017-09-24 02:53:52	tamouse__	EXACTLY
2017-09-24 02:54:06	Tekk_	Taint mode is probably perl's weirdest and coolest feature
2017-09-24 02:54:11	mrm	Is perl still a thing?
2017-09-24 02:54:20	tamouse__	i still write some
2017-09-24 02:54:30	Tekk_	I write stuff
2017-09-24 02:55:12	tamouse__	seems like a lot of one off one liners...
2017-09-24 02:55:52	Tekk_	Actually I'm writing perl atm to keep my server up to date
2017-09-24 02:56:10	Tekk_	openbsd doesn't have an automatic tool for "update all of my installed ports that need updating"
2017-09-24 02:57:12	Tekk_	(Sadly testing this is a huge pain, so debug cycles are very......slow......)
2017-09-24 02:57:16	mrm	That doesn't actually mean it's a thing. This is #emacs. We can probably find someone here who uses a mix of maclisp and algol for their personal blog.

2017-09-24 03:15:13	Tekk_	sql injections are a failure of the server software to distrust user iput

2017-09-24 03:20:21	gnome2	Is there any emacs-wide variable that can be set to gently suggest all modes to use a given indentation offset? I've been setting mode-specific indentation-offset variables, but I wonder if there's an easier way...
2017-09-24 03:20:53	Tekk_	There's no universal way. I find that c-basic-offset affects the *most* modes

2017-09-24 03:23:01	wasamasa	too large

2017-09-24 07:28:06	parsnip	interesting that it doesn't prompt though there seems to be ambiguity in having two for the same. maybe it takes the newer one?
2017-09-24 07:28:12	codingquark	Second mail?
2017-09-24 07:28:26	codingquark	See, there are two keys. Both are associated with the same email.
2017-09-24 07:28:40	parsnip	oh, i thought you had a second email you were trying to sign.
2017-09-24 07:29:43	codingquark	Hmmm, there is --edit-keys
2017-09-24 07:29:51	codingquark	*key
2017-09-24 07:30:13	parsnip	did you already push both keys to keyserver?
2017-09-24 07:30:31	parsnip	do you have a revoke key?
2017-09-24 07:31:06	Hasimir	careful, once you push a revocation it can't be undone

2017-09-24 07:31:53	codingquark	I'll just disable the key for now...
2017-09-24 07:31:55	codingquark	How about that?
2017-09-24 07:32:00	codingquark	I'm not going to revoke that.
2017-09-24 07:32:11	codingquark	Or I can change the UID
2017-09-24 07:32:49	<--	newcoder (~newcoder@unaffiliated/newcoder) has left #emacs
2017-09-24 07:33:11	codingquark	Yes, I can delete the UID from this one.
2017-09-24 07:33:11	Hasimir	up to you, but I'd have a play with the gnus confic example I linked to as well, it explicitly shows setting an email address and a key ID for the address.
2017-09-24 07:33:26	Hasimir	*config
2017-09-24 07:33:43	codingquark	Well, this key has two IDs with it. And I don't want to use one of those IDs which are in conflict.

2017-09-24 07:34:02	codingquark	keybase.io generated this key for me with 2 UIDs in 2015
2017-09-24 07:34:16	Hasimir	oh
2017-09-24 07:34:18	bremner	yikes. people generate keys on web sites?
2017-09-24 07:34:49	Hasimir	bremner, that's why I'm not a fan of that site (even though I have a profile there)
2017-09-24 07:35:17	bremner	iirc, you can also upload, but yeah, seems like a potential trap
2017-09-24 07:35:18	codingquark	bremner: no, they don't generate on site. They have some native CLI
2017-09-24 07:35:36	codingquark	I've stopped using it long ago, but I have account there.
2017-09-24 07:35:42	Hasimir	yeah, I've scolded their admins in the past for stupid shit ...
2017-09-24 07:35:51	Hasimir	sorry, not admins, owners

2017-09-24 07:36:47	Hasimir	it's fine as another place to plonk my public key, but I don't use their node.js shit
2017-09-24 07:37:10	codingquark	Yea! They've node client!
2017-09-24 07:37:18	codingquark	I certainly did not like that.
2017-09-24 07:37:27	Hasimir	:)
2017-09-24 07:37:43	parsnip	someday, i will put a public key there, and actually use it.
2017-09-24 07:38:02	codingquark	Yes, removing the UID worked.
2017-09-24 07:38:13	python476	hey there

2017-09-24 07:38:33	python476	I'm having trouble with (re-search-forward "^.+$")
2017-09-24 07:38:36	codingquark	,greet python476
2017-09-24 07:38:36	fsbot	Dobrý den python476.
2017-09-24 07:38:42	bremner	codingquark: there's a bunch of variables you can set related to key selection
2017-09-24 07:38:42	codingquark	Oh damn, you messaged first.
2017-09-24 07:38:52	parsnip	python476: what trouble?
2017-09-24 07:38:54	python476	on "empty" newlines it doesn't move the point
2017-09-24 07:39:20	python476	infinite loops ensues
2017-09-24 07:39:27	Hasimir	heh
2017-09-24 07:39:30	codingquark	bremner: I felt having two keys associated with one email account sounds wrong.
2017-09-24 07:39:46	 *	bremner shrugs
2017-09-24 07:39:53	parsnip	codingquark: how come?
2017-09-24 07:40:21	parsnip	bremner: in gnus/message, or gpg? i didn't see any in emacs for gpg.
2017-09-24 07:40:22	codingquark	parsnip: would you use two signatures for the same bank account?
2017-09-24 07:40:45	bremner	codingquark: it's pretty common, due to key transitions if nothing else
2017-09-24 07:40:59	codingquark	bremner: Oh, I see.
2017-09-24 07:41:10	codingquark	Then I should look at the variables you speak of.
2017-09-24 07:41:15	parsnip	codingquark: i wish i could. one for logging in to read only.
2017-09-24 07:41:16	bremner	codingquark: but sure, if you don't use the key, it doesn't matter.
2017-09-24 07:41:49	codingquark	Well, the problem is solved for now. Thanks parsnip, bremner, Hasimir :)
