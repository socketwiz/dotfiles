2017-02-26 10:14:55	Socketwiz	Hey guys, I installed openstack through conjure-up on ubuntu v16.04 and everything worked perfectly. I was able to create a VM, ping it and ssh into it.  And then...I rebooted.  Everything seems to come back up just fine, juju status is happy, no errors, but I am unable to ping or ssh into my instance.  Any ideas what I can try to resolve this issue?

2017-02-26 20:54:23	dureya	when I installed the os onto the dell it couldn't configure the DHCP.
2017-02-26 20:54:29	dureya	would that cause it?
2017-02-26 20:55:14	dureya	in ifconfig i got lo, and virbr0
2017-02-26 20:55:19	JanC	if you didn't set manual DNS servers and you don't get them from DHCP, yes
2017-02-26 20:55:42	JanC	sounds like you get no network at all then
2017-02-26 20:56:25	dureya	well, I am currently on the cmd now, is there any guide that I could use to get up the DHCP and the DNS server?

2017-02-26 21:08:00	JanC	not before you find out why it doesn't see the network devices, e.g.: are they enabled in the UEFI firmware, do they need a firmware (some WiFi need that), do they need a driver that is not included, ...

2017-02-26 21:26:22	JanC	it's for another network adapter though, but it also tries to use the same included driver which doesn't work
2017-02-26 21:26:38	dureya	oh...
2017-02-26 21:27:45	JanC	I suppose it's an unsupported variation of the same family of network chips

2017-02-26 21:29:39	dureya	I am not sure how old it is. I got it from my uncle today and it is running on an intel core i3. Its a dell inspiron; ubuntu version is the recent ubuntu server release
2017-02-26 21:32:53	JanC	I was thinking a ballpark figure (and it should have a date somewhere at the bottom)

2017-02-26 21:47:45	JanC	another option is to use an USB WiFi or USB ethernet that you already know works well

I would like to change this to be 6 months and purge the rest (trying to recover hd space here).. would it be just a matter of changing the daily retention to what I need inside rsnapshot.conf?

I also assigned 192.168.1.100 as the ip address by modifying /etc/networks/interfaces adding dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 as well as setting the .100 as reserved in my router (nighthawk).
2017-02-27 17:27:17	peterd	I've run sudo apt-get auto clean, sudo apt-get clean and / is still 100% used.
2017-02-27 17:27:19	peterd	Thoughts on what to try next?

When I run "mysql -uroot", however, I get "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'". I then run mysql_safe_installation and set a password for the root user, and I still get the same error over and over again when logging in with "mysql -uroot -p" and typing the correct password. any hint?
2017-02-27 19:19:08	nacc	teward: how do you mean?

2017-02-27 19:32:51	nacc	teward: so this is a nginx test?
2017-02-27 19:33:01	teward	because i think they added a curve we don't support that got in from Experimental
2017-02-27 19:33:02	teward	nacc: well...

2017-02-27 19:33:17	teward	(1) NGINX tests fail with Regression, I think it's because there's a curve added to the tests
2017-02-27 19:33:17	nacc	teward: it might be apporpirate to add delta is some test depends ona  feature we odn't support
2017-02-27 19:33:32	teward	(2) a *different* autopkgtest errors out
2017-02-27 19:33:34	teward	but *not* because of nginx
2017-02-27 19:33:44	nacc	teward: let me look
2017-02-27 19:33:45	teward	nacc: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html#nginx
2017-02-27 19:34:05	teward	diaspora-installer is the only other one I am not looking into but those errors look like it's a repository problem *not* related ot nginx
2017-02-27 19:34:22	nacc	teward: ack, so you're saying we should skip the ec-x25519 test on ubuntu?
2017-02-27 19:34:49	teward	nacc: i'm saying "probably", but I need to figure out its origin
2017-02-27 19:34:57	teward	first
2017-02-27 19:34:58	nacc	teward: that should be done via a delta to the src package that either comments out (i prefer this but it's up to you, i think) or deletes it from d/t/control
2017-02-27 19:35:19	teward	nacc: I want to figure out if it's from Debian Exp. or not first
2017-02-27 19:35:24	nacc	teward: ack
2017-02-27 19:35:27	teward	that said I need a Debian image too to test
2017-02-27 19:35:30	nacc	teward: i'm looking at the other one
2017-02-27 19:35:36	nacc	teward: lxc launch images:debian/sid/amd64
2017-02-27 19:35:38	teward	if it works in Debian but not Ubuntu, then it's a delta that we can comment out for the test
2017-02-27 19:35:42	teward	nacc:  already ahead of you
2017-02-27 19:35:48	nacc	teward: and/or check ci.debian.net
2017-02-27 19:35:49	teward	but i'm installing the ubuntu-server image in an lxc container.
2017-02-27 19:35:59	teward	or rather, installing that metapackage
2017-02-27 19:36:04	teward	so i have a 'standard' set of crap lol

2017-02-27 19:36:13	nacc	seems rather green
2017-02-27 19:36:39	teward	nacc:  yeah but i want to make sure that this test is 'new'
2017-02-27 19:36:55	teward	and if it's not 'new' then poke the Security team for a check on OpenSSL in Ubuntu to see if they dropped the curve or something

2017-02-27 19:39:39	teward	for Ubuntu anyways
2017-02-27 19:39:57	teward	gonna check that list vs. Debian and if the list is different then ignroe the check here in ubuntu by commenting out as part of the Delta

2017-02-27 19:47:40	teward	so that's just a curve we don't accept.

2017-02-27 19:49:20	nacc	teward: no, 1.0.2g on zesty
2017-02-27 19:49:35	nacc	teward: add a delta, each test is a stanza in d/t/control
2017-02-27 19:49:48	teward	yes but define "delta" as in drop the test or comment out the entire test?
2017-02-27 19:49:57	nacc	teward: and then i'd say in the changelog entry (so we know for merges) that once we are at openssl 1.1.0 we can drop it
2017-02-27 19:50:04	nacc	teward: totally up to you
2017-02-27 19:50:25	nacc	teward: if we did everything with an SCM, then i'd say delete it, but it's a little more self-documenting if commented out
2017-02-27 19:50:46	teward	nacc: I actually have a copy of the packaging in a GitLab instance of my own, so it's sorta version controlled.
2017-02-27 19:51:09	nacc	teward: and since you are the maintainer, i think that's ok then to just drop it and you'd know
2017-02-27 19:51:27	teward	nacc: yep, well I'm just going to remove it from d/t/control but leave the test "in there"
2017-02-27 19:51:30	nacc	teward: if someone were to come along and do teh team workflow to re-merge it, it'd also be obvious what corresponds to what, i think

2017-02-28 07:14:07	maswan	hm. one case we haven't tried so far in pinning the blame is dd:ing directly to the block device.
2017-02-28 07:15:02	cpaelzer	maswan: raw access and/or an alternative fs (like ext4) can be worth a shot for sure
2017-02-28 07:15:30	maswan	let me get iostat for the fast case first though
2017-02-28 07:15:36	cpaelzer	absolutely
2017-02-28 07:15:40	maswan	hm. do you want iostat for the first-good mainline kernel too?
2017-02-28 07:16:19	cpaelzer	as I read the bug I thought that comparing 3.18.21-031821.201509020527 vs 3.18.22-031822.201510031227 should be best right?
2017-02-28 07:16:27	maswan	yes
2017-02-28 07:16:27	cpaelzer	that is minimal delta in terms of patches
2017-02-28 07:16:39	maswan	Will do that, just ran it on whatever it was booted on first.
2017-02-28 07:16:39	cpaelzer	so I'd compare those until we have a reason to look further
2017-02-28 07:16:52	maswan	and then thought harder of what would be best for comparison. :)
2017-02-28 07:16:55	cpaelzer	to pick those two will avoid us seeing a lot of "other" noise in logs
2017-02-28 07:24:17	maswan	ho hum
2017-02-28 07:24:21	maswan	hp servers are slow to boot
2017-02-28 07:24:35	patdk-lap	slow is an understatement
2017-02-28 07:25:23	maswan	I heard quite a bit of grumbling yesterday when Nikke was bisecting kernel versions and had to wait for a reboot between each test
2017-02-28 07:29:37	maswan	There, iostat and command line output from the last fast and first slow 3.18.2* kernels
2017-02-28 07:30:01	 *	cpaelzer reading
2017-02-28 07:31:19	maswan	and on the slow kernel, pretty much identical performance for dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=256k, possibly slightly slower
2017-02-28 07:36:54	cpaelzer	it seems it no more recognized this as a raid
2017-02-28 07:37:04	cpaelzer	so the block device layer is holding back requests to merge them
2017-02-28 07:37:15	cpaelzer	maswan: you see write reqeust merges per sec ~500
2017-02-28 07:37:25	cpaelzer	maswan: and due to that ~8x bigger write requests
2017-02-28 07:37:39	cpaelzer	maswan: which in your case sucks, as the raid below will split it along its stripe size again

2017-02-28 07:48:31	cpaelzer	yet the request merging is a hotter lead which should be pursued first
2017-02-28 07:48:46	cpaelzer	OTOH the reboots seems to be what slows you down, so we might collect what we can do each cycle
2017-02-28 07:48:57	maswan	well, the first test of dd into a file on xfs is very close to the production case
2017-02-28 07:49:22	maswan	which is taking large files from network onto disk (and then spooling them to tape, or the other way around)
2017-02-28 07:49:50	maswan	before ingest rate it could handle was line speed 10GE
2017-02-28 07:50:17	cpaelzer	ok, if close to the real cae lets stick to that for now
2017-02-28 07:50:56	maswan	well, single file all zeros is already a simplifcation of it. but sure, I can try some oflag=direct while I'm booted anyway. :)
2017-02-28 07:52:12	maswan	only diff is max_sectors_kb, 4096->512

2017-02-28 07:54:12	maswan	so probably no need for more narrow dd test cases
2017-02-28 07:54:16	cpaelzer	maswan: exactly
2017-02-28 07:54:31	cpaelzer	maswan: I still struggle to see the patch that causes it, but there is a workaround for you to test
2017-02-28 07:54:45	cpaelzer	maswan: boot the slow kernel and set 512 into that calue

2017-02-28 08:02:17	cpaelzer	it is correct to "fix" it, yet in your case with the drives very likely not having 4k formatting and the strip-size/offset being different it comes to the need of tuning that now
2017-02-28 08:02:25	cpaelzer	maswan: let me know how setting 512 worked for you

2017-02-28 08:04:51	cpaelzer	yeah
2017-02-28 08:05:03	cpaelzer	maswan: for more tuning, have you tried the rotational=0 as well?
2017-02-28 08:06:25	cpaelzer	maswan: TL;DR IMHO the controller always announces 4k, instead of being smart and on a certain raid setup drop to the stripe or sector size
2017-02-28 08:06:42	cpaelzer	maswan: newer linux "fixes" now pick these values up correctly which makes it slower for you :-/

2017-02-28 08:09:43	maswan	We're good with setting that in our setup, maybe hpsa authors should be prodded that they shouldn't advertise larger blocks to the kernel than they can (reasonably) handle?
2017-02-28 08:10:21	cpaelzer	maswan: as I said they correctly say what they "can" handle, but an option to "advertise what is smart instead of what we can"might be worth
2017-02-28 08:10:28	cpaelzer	maswan: if you have contacts at least ask them
2017-02-28 08:10:42	maswan	not really
2017-02-28 08:11:23	maswan	hm. I guess they might be reading linux-raid though, I'm a long time lurker in there
2017-02-28 08:11:54	maswan	Please close it with as much info you can think of on the causes etc
2017-02-28 08:13:28	cpaelzer	maswan: done

Looking at http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cloud-archive/mitaka-staging/ubuntu/dists/ and http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cloud-archive/newton-staging/ubuntu/dists/ looks like there is not a Openstack release supporting both trusty and xenial.

2017-02-28 12:20:00	nacc	rbasak: but for the rest that still fail, it's all the FF issue for the -devel branches
2017-02-28 12:20:07	rbasak	OK
2017-02-28 12:20:08	nacc	rbasak: are you ok with me implementing the merge idea?
2017-02-28 12:20:22	nacc	rbasak: that is, the -devel branches stay FF by merging the new commit and the old head?
2017-02-28 12:21:04	rbasak	Yes, but I think we need to be consistent. So we should bump the -devel branch on every version, not just at the end.
2017-02-28 12:21:24	rbasak	I don't know if that'd be quite a big refactoring?
2017-02-28 12:21:40	rbasak	But otherwise the data structure obtained would be dependent on timing of imports, which I think would be bad.
2017-02-28 12:22:02	nacc	so the -devel branch would become quite a bit 'noisier', but would be be correct
2017-02-28 12:22:24	nacc	it will also slow it down a bit, if it has to do the check for every pocket on every import
2017-02-28 12:22:25	rbasak	Yeah
2017-02-28 12:22:32	rbasak	If refactoring, please take my refactoring branch first.
2017-02-28 12:24:22	rbasak	nacc: it's just a local and inexpensive check though, no?
2017-02-28 12:24:53	nacc	it's not entirely inexpensive, it has to look at each head in a given series and decide which is 'latest'
2017-02-28 12:25:14	nacc	refactored, i might be able to restrict it to the affected series, so it might not be a big deal
2017-02-28 12:27:00	rbasak	OK
2017-02-28 12:30:54	nacc	rbasak: the only other concenr is the abvoe chagne means existing imports are 'incorrect' or would differ from from-scratch imports
2017-02-28 12:31:06	nacc	rbasak: i think that's unavoidable for now, though
2017-02-28 12:31:32	rbasak	Agreed on both.
2017-02-28 12:31:41	nacc	rbasak: ack, thanks!
2017-02-28 12:31:42	rbasak	Incidentally, I had a thought related to this.
2017-02-28 12:31:51	nacc	sure
2017-02-28 12:32:02	rbasak	Adopting upload tags (or not) also mutates the commit hashes.

2017-02-28 12:32:17	rbasak	And upload tags may arrive late, in which case they won't be adopted.
2017-02-28 12:32:39	rbasak	So perhaps we could use "git notes" to add a note to tell us whether a particular upload tag has been seen or not, and whether it was adopted or not.
2017-02-28 12:32:47	nacc	yes, i think we discussed this at the sprint
2017-02-28 12:32:55	nacc	sure
2017-02-28 12:33:04	rbasak	Then the importer could run in a mode where it only adopts upload tags that were previously adopted.
2017-02-28 12:33:18	rbasak	And then third parties have the option of not mutating things.
2017-02-28 12:33:25	nacc	we also discusssed *always* taking the upload tag, but there might be a diff between it an and the import tag (as opposed to ignoring them now)
2017-02-28 12:33:28	nacc	true
2017-02-28 12:33:49	teward	rbasak: not sure if you saw my highlight from last night, nginx merge is completed, and now out of zesty-proposed and in zesty proper.

2017-02-28 12:34:08	nacc	rbasak: let's hold off on that for now, if taht's ok with you? we can talk about it next week. I'll file it as a bug if it's not already

2017-02-28 12:34:21	teward	rbasak: you may have but it gets buried under the cruft i see here - limited RAM on my system running my boucer
2017-02-28 12:34:29	rbasak	Just thought I'd mention it while we were talking about mutations.

2017-02-28 12:35:02	teward	rbasak: I'll update the package page I created for the triage stuff to indicate "New Features as of Zesty:" section.  And some "Runtime Notes" about the fPIE/fPIC impact on 32bit systems

2017-02-28 12:38:05	teward	and a reorg of the packages because of binary changes, etc.
2017-02-28 12:38:45	teward	as for "new" features, the big one's dynamic module support, but we can have "More Details" on the ServerTeam/Nginx page.
2017-02-28 12:38:48	teward	since that's now a thing :P
2017-02-28 12:38:58	teward	the big one's going to be fPIE/fPIC and "Performance Notes"
2017-02-28 12:39:17	nacc	teward: sounds good :)
2017-02-28 12:39:24	teward	because with just fPIE there's not a huge performance hit, with fPIE+fPIC which is needed this time around, we have a higher impact this time around
2017-02-28 12:39:50	teward	(though we've been rolling fPIE since Trusty I think, so that impact is already known.  No, I don't have exact benchmarks unfortunately.)

2017-02-28 15:26:30	fullstop	Hi all.  Is there something different with 16.04 where it fills up /boot with kernels automatically?  I don't have unattended upgrades enabled, but it seems to be doing it anyway.

2017-02-28 15:28:50	fullstop	it appears that unattended upgrades for security related things was somehow enabled.
2017-02-28 15:36:02	scottjl	fullstop: look at /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades and see what's been uncommented
2017-02-28 15:36:22	scottjl	by default kernels aren't upgraded though
2017-02-28 15:36:44	fullstop	yes, I see why it's doing it..
2017-02-28 15:36:55	fullstop	but I have no idea how this was set.
2017-02-28 15:37:08	scottjl	someone/something changed it.
2017-02-28 15:37:21	fullstop	and it's enabled on all the 16.04 servers we have here.
2017-02-28 15:37:28	scottjl	puppet?
2017-02-28 15:37:31	scottjl	salt?
2017-02-28 15:37:36	fullstop	but none of the 14.04 or 12.04 (which are slated for retirement)
2017-02-28 15:37:42	fullstop	salt
2017-02-28 15:37:52	fullstop	but the same states are used on all.
2017-02-28 15:37:53	scottjl	none of my 16.04 servers are like that in a fresh setup
2017-02-28 15:38:00	scottjl	check your salt config then?
2017-02-28 15:38:21	scottjl	that's not standard 16.04 behavior
2017-02-28 15:38:28	fullstop	let me find some non-salt ones.
2017-02-28 15:38:41	sarnold	I thought we made that the default for 16.04?
2017-02-28 15:38:59	scottjl	kernel upgrades? not automatic. unless it's new with 16.04.02?
2017-02-28 15:39:44	scottjl	well at least. mine aren't doing it (thank god)
2017-02-28 15:39:49	fullstop	all of mine are

2017-02-28 15:40:51	fullstop	this kind of sucks because /boot has run out of space on many of them.
2017-02-28 15:43:00	rbasak	unattended-upgrades is enabled by default since 16.04 I think.
2017-02-28 15:43:11	rbasak	But if it causes /boot to fill up, that's bad and we need to fix that.

2017-02-28 15:44:27	fullstop	 /boot is pretty small with the default settings.  It can hold just a few kernels before getting plugged up, which prevents apt from really working at all until you manually get involved and clean it up.
2017-02-28 15:45:04	fullstop	If the server were restarted before it filled, I'm still not certain that old kernels would be purged.
2017-02-28 15:45:20	teward	rbasak: thanks, feel free to improve :)
2017-02-28 15:45:20	scottjl	i gave up making /boot a separate partition years ago. it's just part of /

2017-02-28 15:47:04	sarnold	funny enough my laptop appears to have six kernels, ~300 megs of /boot and my server seven, for ~385 megs of /boot

2017-03-01 04:12:24	cpaelzer	jamespage: Debian would go the "recommends" with me and we could drop some delta

2017-03-01 04:26:43	cpaelzer	freakynl: stress-ng --vm 2 --vm-populate should give you ~512MB pressure that is swappable - in a second console you can check if it does indeed swap while these are running

2017-03-01 04:37:55	freakynl	Not sure what that does with the open-vm-tools
2017-03-01 04:40:59	freakynl	cpaelzer: Hmm was getting those results but had to reboot it first for fresh values, 3rd time I rebooted it, completed the upgrades now. Only 2.6M in swap now
2017-03-01 04:45:51	cpaelzer	freakynl: I read a bit, it really could be the ballooning which has issues with your too constrained system
2017-03-01 04:46:29	cpaelzer	freakynl: usually you'd rather slighly oversize a guest and balloon it down (+swap in the host if ever needed) instead of swapping in the guest
2017-03-01 04:47:00	cpaelzer	freakynl: there can be weird cases of double faults if the guest swaps in itself - onto a page that is swapped out by the host, to be swapped in by the host , ...
2017-03-01 04:47:20	cpaelzer	freakynl: so I can't blame anybody to try to avoid, but I'd think in your super small system that might cause problems
2017-03-01 04:47:29	cpaelzer	freakynl: I'm happy you could pass the update
2017-03-01 04:47:34	freakynl	cpaelzer: system runs fine when not updating :). Really doesn't do that much. 18MB mysql database + powerdns. Normally doesn't hit swap, but needs some more ram during initramfs creation. It's not swapping in the hypervisor at all
2017-03-01 04:47:53	cpaelzer	freakynl: but you might try the workload I sent and disable ballooning to see if your system could swap fine then
2017-03-01 04:48:23	cpaelzer	freakynl: depending on that insight you can then either keep it balooning but increase size or disable it or ... (whatever you choose)
2017-03-01 04:48:30	freakynl	cpaelzer: Yea I'll disable ballooning, the host has plenty of memory anyways, vmware charges for RAM assigned to VM under VSPP though :)
2017-03-01 04:49:31	cpaelzer	freakynl: I'd hope they do not charge for what is ballooned down
2017-03-01 04:49:53	cpaelzer	freakynl: I like the business case - you have to pay in your supermarket for a full cart, no matter how full you make it :-)
2017-03-01 04:50:05	cpaelzer	because you could fill it up
2017-03-01 04:52:11	freakynl	cpaelzer: well under VSPP you get charged by the memory assigned to a VM. Or more accurately the *reserved* RAM for an instance, but if nothing is reserved they'll count a minimum of 50% of the RAM. Billing is capped at 24G, so a VM with 128G of RAM would still only cost 24G of RAM. But that's the only thing you pay, no CPU's, storage, etc. They have to base it on something I guess. Flat fee per
2017-03-01 04:52:17	freakynl	instance wouldn't be doable either
2017-03-01 04:53:31	cpaelzer	yep, with that details it sounds ok

2017-03-01 05:07:55	freakynl	ren0v0: try backing up /var/lib/mysql and removing and reinstall mysql-server after that
2017-03-01 05:08:22	ren0v0	freakynl, would much rather get it running and take a proper dump, thats a last resort really
2017-03-01 05:09:06	freakynl	ren0v0: yes the main goal of that would be to get it running, the back-up is just in case, afaik removing mysql-server doesn't remove the databases
2017-03-01 05:09:22	freakynl	ren0v0: just a safety precaution
2017-03-01 05:10:01	ren0v0	i see ok
2017-03-01 05:10:06	ren0v0	here are some logs from syslog   https://paste.ubuntu.com/24089229/

2017-03-01 05:11:13	ren0v0	yea, i'll try it again now
2017-03-01 05:11:26	ren0v0	mysql5.7 is kept back
2017-03-01 05:11:30	ren0v0	not sure if thats related
2017-03-01 05:11:59	freakynl	ren0v0: I'd personally migrate to mariadb, usually drop-in replacement

2017-03-01 05:12:16	ren0v0	this is for zoneminder
2017-03-01 05:12:28	freakynl	ren0v0: they're binary compatible
2017-03-01 05:12:45	ren0v0	freakynl, i took a snapshot of this container luckily, when i upgraded my ZM database was gone.

2017-03-01 05:17:21	freakynl	mariadb or mysql?
2017-03-01 05:17:27	ren0v0	mysql
2017-03-01 05:17:33	ren0v0	now i can move onto install mariadb
2017-03-01 05:17:59	ren0v0	thanks for the help
2017-03-01 05:19:20	freakynl	ren0v0: last time I did it it was just removing mysql-server and installing mariadb-server

2017-03-01 06:57:12	zioproto	jamespage, coreycb I was able to compile the nova package versione 13.1.3 I pushed stable/mitaka and pristine-tar branches to https://code.launchpad.net/~zioproto/ubuntu/+source/nova/+git/nova    How does it work for the merge request on launchpad ? I have to do 1 MR for each branch ? I will be testing the new package on our staging cluster. I will do the merge request when I am sure it is okay.
2017-03-01 06:58:27	jamespage	zioproto: yeah its one merge for each branch - so rather than do that I'd suggest that you just propose the review for the stable/mitaka branch, and note on the review that the upstream and pristine-tar branches will also need a review
2017-03-01 07:00:10	zioproto	great, the gbp import magic also updated the upstream branch ad added a tag, you are right

2017-03-10 06:17:50	ronator	Hi. I am learning systemd unit files. I have a 'stupid' php process I need to stop. Only way is with kill. On CMD it works really fast: "kill -15 $(pidof php)". But if I do this with systemctl (ExecStop) it takes almost exactly 1:30 minutes to stop/kill the process. Is that a systemd problem? What am I doing wrong?

2017-03-10 06:32:45	Doow	What exactly is it that triggers apache on boot (16.10)? I see no indications in the logs of it even trying to start on my server.
2017-03-10 06:35:01	ronator	there shoud be a apache.service file somewhere on your system - or not (/lib/systemd or /etc/systemd)
2017-03-10 06:35:08	ronator	or apache2.service
2017-03-10 06:36:01	ronator	"service" now also uses systemctl so what does "sude service apache status" or similiar say?
2017-03-10 06:36:37	Doow	ronator, is that what actually triggers it? because "sudo systemctl enable apache2.service" says that it can't be enabled via systemd (gimme a sec and I'll pastebin it)
2017-03-10 06:37:05	ronator	I think I read that apache still does not offer unit files for systemd ...
2017-03-10 06:37:08	ronator	no sure

2017-03-10 06:39:30	ronator	well you could get a basic apache systemd unit file and drop it into /etc/systemd/system - or you could use nginx (different syntax but some like it more than apache - and it has systemd unit files)

2017-03-10 06:41:25	Doow	ronator, it *can* start automatically, it's just that something went broke on my system
2017-03-10 06:41:35	Doow	and I can't figure out what
2017-03-10 06:41:42	ronator	check /var/log/syslog?
2017-03-10 06:42:14	ronator	and dmesg - if something went broke you need to find out what - or windows-style re-install
2017-03-10 06:42:15	Doow	nothing, I can't find any trace of it in any logs (which is I wanted to know what exactly is supposed to trigger it)
2017-03-10 06:42:53	ronator	well from my understanding it cant start automatically because no systemd unit file is there and system cant for some reason create it on the fly
2017-03-10 06:43:02	Doow	I'm not even sure it tries to start
2017-03-10 06:43:33	ronator	did you upgrade from 15.10 or 14.10 or so?
2017-03-10 06:43:40	Doow	no, clean install
2017-03-10 06:43:56	ronator	that's a shame, apache ...
2017-03-10 06:44:15	ronator	clean install should not have messed up your system ;-)
2017-03-10 06:44:46	Doow	I of course have done things on the system, but after the install =)
2017-03-10 06:45:09	ronator	so i think it is still the case of the missing systemd file
2017-03-10 06:45:29	ronator	suggestion: quick install of nginx, see how that behaves on your system
2017-03-10 06:45:41	ronator	if that behaves better, blame apache
2017-03-10 06:46:25	Doow	that isn't really helpful though I'm trying to solve the problem, not find someone/something to blame =P
2017-03-10 06:46:52	ronator	well but to solve it you must find the reason that is to blame
2017-03-10 06:47:14	ronator	and i guess it is a huge problem that apache ships without systemd file (if that is still true)
2017-03-10 06:48:46	ronator	I can only tell you, I assume it is missing system files for apache. so with nginx you could somehow prove that (if nginx has no issues). And if yiou then decide to try a systemd unit file for apache, you may well take the nginx one, modify it and boom
2017-03-10 06:49:21	ronator	make sure you work in /etc/systemd/system path for such experiments
2017-03-10 06:49:37	Doow	it ships with a systemd file, it just don't have an [install] section. So you can't set it to automatically start from there.
2017-03-10 06:49:52	ronator	mokay let me think a sec
2017-03-10 06:50:17	Doow	there's a setup of glue scripts to let systemd work with it (as mentioned in the bug you linked)

2017-03-10 07:33:29	ronator	maybe there is a dovecot option to allow self signed? I am totally guessing right now.
2017-03-10 07:34:41	Genk1	ronator, usually I don't came here frist when I have an issue
2017-03-10 07:34:49	Genk1	I always start by the official documentation

2017-03-10 07:34:55	Genk1	then IRC :P
2017-03-10 07:35:17	ronator	no offense, just making my point why I cant help you effectively :)

2017-03-10 11:15:13	scottjl	anything root does, they could erase out of syslog, unless you're using an external server

2017-03-10 11:15:42	Genk1	well I need such thing in a centralized log server

2017-03-10 11:15:57	scottjl	but it doesn't log shell commands

2017-03-10 11:20:27	scottjl	so your team has to decide if they really want security, or just the illusion

2017-03-10 13:41:26	drab	Genk1: a common one is "rootsh"
2017-03-10 13:41:37	drab	the other common tool for that is "snoopy"
2017-03-10 13:41:59	drab	and "sniffy"
2017-03-10 13:42:09	drab	it was a while back tho, dunno if those projects are still active/working
2017-03-10 13:43:18	drab	the more modern and possible "correct" way of doing it is using "auditd", which can be configured to track all exec syscalls
2017-03-10 13:43:40	drab	https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20150604 has some examples
2017-03-10 13:44:03	drab	and http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2010/11/requirement-10-track-and-monitor-all.html

2017-03-10 15:45:01	ThiagoCMC	Hey guys! With QEmu 2.5 and Libvirt 1.3.1 (Ubuntu 16.04 plus Newton Cloud Archive, just to get new DPDK and new OVS), I was able to run KVM with hugepages and numa placement, like this:
2017-03-10 15:45:11	ThiagoCMC	"<cell id='0' cpus='0-3' memory='8388608' unit='KiB' memAccess='shared'/>"
2017-03-10 15:45:18	ThiagoCMC	Works great!
2017-03-10 15:45:30	ThiagoCMC	However, now, I upgraded it to QEmu 2.8 and Libvirt 2.5 (Ocata Cloud Archive), and my VM is not booting anymore, with the following error: "Error starting domain: unsupported configuration: Shared memory mapping is supported only with hugepages"
2017-03-10 15:45:37	ThiagoCMC	What is happening?

2017-03-10 15:46:05	ThiagoCMC	I had to remove the "memAccess", like this: "<cell id='0' cpus='0-3' memory='8388608' unit='KiB'/>"
2017-03-10 15:46:12	ThiagoCMC	 So, the VM booted but, why?
2017-03-10 15:46:28	ThiagoCMC	hugepages are enabled and I don't get why facing that error...   :-(
2017-03-10 15:46:28	ThiagoCMC	   Any clue?

2017-03-10 20:18:35	Jordan_U	Hi. I have a fresh Ubuntu server installation with apache2 installed and I would like to simply configure it so that for any page that is not found the user is sent to /dnshelp.html . This is the full contents of my /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf http://paste.ubuntu.com/24154871/ . I have only changed it by adding lines 30 and 31. I still get a generic apache 404 error page though.
2017-03-10 20:18:41	Jordan_U	I'm assuming I'm missing something simple, anyone see what it is? :)
2017-03-10 20:21:11	sarnold	Jordan_U: did you reload the apache configuration? what entries do you get in the error.log and access.log when making requests that should use this 404/

2017-03-10 20:26:11	Jordan_U	sarnold: Unfortunately makes no change. If I restart apache2 again afterward I get the same error.
2017-03-10 20:26:31	sarnold	okay, good. so, next step, what's in the apache logs?

2017-03-11 03:17:16	cpaelzer	ThiagoCMC: nacc: Newer libvirt needs you to specify the page size
2017-03-11 03:17:25	cpaelzer	ThiagoCMC: that is not a "bug" in the to-be-fixed sense
2017-03-11 03:17:36	cpaelzer	ThiagoCMC: and the doc is for 16.04 still :-/
2017-03-11 03:17:51	cpaelzer	ThiagoCMC: in the past I already made FYI updates there for newer openvswitch versions that changed
2017-03-11 03:18:07	cpaelzer	ThiagoCMC: I'll do so again, for this, but doc releases take time
2017-03-11 03:18:19	cpaelzer	ThiagoCMC: until then a change like following will fix it for you

2017-03-11 10:45:16	jiffe	so I've started install of ubuntu on a machine a couple times now to play with configuration, the network interface list seems kind of strange.  I've got my cable plugged into nic0, initially the list shows enO0 and rename[123], then it showed eno1 with rename[123], now its showing eno1 with rename[345]
2017-03-11 10:46:14	jiffe	and I'm having to guess which rename is actually eno0

2017-03-11 10:57:19	tomreyn	i still don'T get what the rename1 ... is
2017-03-11 10:57:39	jiffe	I'll likely be going through this again so I can take a screenshot here in a bit
2017-03-11 10:57:42	tomreyn	are you saying these are kernel processes renaming the network interfaces?
2017-03-11 10:59:57	jiffe	I don't know whats doing the renaming, when I load the ubuntu install disk and it gets to the point of listing network interfaces, those are the names of the interfaces (eno1, rename3, rename4, rename5), there are 4 interfaces
2017-03-11 11:00:51	tomreyn	oh, well i've never come across network interfaces called "rename*"

2017-03-11 11:27:09	jiffe	the alternative I think is to use software raid1 for / and GPT and zfs for the remainder
