2017-03-10 21:18:44	codehotter	OK so I'm trying to understand layering and updating images
2017-03-10 21:19:11	codehotter	let's say I have one image that installs the webserver and an image on top of that that has my website installed
2017-03-10 21:19:15	codehotter	now I want to update the webserver version
2017-03-10 21:19:30	codehotter	can it do that just by 'swapping out' the webserver layer or does it have to rebuild everything?
2017-03-10 21:19:36	codehotter	Does that depend on the storage driver?
2017-03-10 21:20:32	diddledan	codehotter: I believe everything below the image that changes needs to be rebuilt, but as a n00b I may be wrong

2017-03-10 21:28:44	diddledan	codehotter: I found this which suggests that layered images don't need rebuilding - only the stuff within the same dockerfile is required to rebuild on changes - so if your website is an image FROM: mywebserver and mywebserver changes then that seemingly doesn't require a rebuild of your website image:

2017-03-10 21:29:53	diddledan	codehotter: so layering images on top of other images is the way to go. doing everything in one dockerfile will cause rebuilds
2017-03-10 21:30:24	decci	All I tried using --net=host but it just bind to singe Docker host interface but I have multiple containers running and I cant use --net=host for each container in a worker nodes
2017-03-10 21:31:15	codehotter	decci: if someone knows the answer and is around they will let you know. Just leave your question here.
2017-03-10 21:31:27	codehotter	you don't need to ask individual people

2017-03-11 03:44:17	dragoonis	so looks like, in my run.sh ( https://gist.github.com/dragoonis/d1ead6e118e0bd590eb3fa184989cd0a ) the "bower install" tries to "git clone" and then I get "unable to look up current user in the passwd file: no such user"

2017-03-11 03:44:52	dragoonis	Yes it works fully as user: root. However all the files get created as "root:root"
2017-03-11 03:44:56	dragoonis	back onto my host
2017-03-11 03:45:04	dragoonis	and on my host I'm user "jenkins" so it's not good
2017-03-11 03:45:08	BretFisher	right, so when you change user inside docker, did you actually create that user first in dockerfile?
2017-03-11 03:45:40	dragoonis	I don't have a Dockerfile, I'm using node:4.7.3 official image.
2017-03-11 03:45:40	BretFisher	what os is this on? the host?
2017-03-11 03:45:50	dragoonis	The host is on Debian Jessie
2017-03-11 03:46:02	BretFisher	ok so not mac or windows?
2017-03-11 03:46:12	dragoonis	Nope, remote EC2 Jessie server.
2017-03-11 03:46:18	BretFisher	k, makes it easier
2017-03-11 03:46:24	BretFisher	mac/win file sharing is harder
2017-03-11 03:46:36	BretFisher	with non-root users + bind mounts... what a mess :)
2017-03-11 03:47:04	dragoonis	I have a workaround hack .. if I do run.sh as root, I then do "chown -R 1001 /var/www/node_modules"
2017-03-11 03:47:06	BretFisher	ok so my first thought is, you're changing user inside container to a user you haven't yet created in container

2017-03-11 03:47:31	dragoonis	This means back on my host that ./node_modules is "jenkins:root"
2017-03-11 03:47:32	BretFisher	right, but you hadn't created that user in container

2017-03-11 03:48:00	BretFisher	you'll need to create that user in container w/ dockerfile or additional CMD stuff
2017-03-11 03:48:08	dragoonis	Additional CMD will work
2017-03-11 03:48:20	BretFisher	and hardcode it to the user ID you need it to act as to play nice with host :)
2017-03-11 03:48:35	dragoonis	What do you recommend my CMD becomes? Right now my CMD is "/var/www/docker/node/run.sh"

2017-03-11 03:50:10	BretFisher	good example: https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/eeb0c33dfcad3db46a0dfb24c352d2a1601c7667/5.7/Dockerfile#L3-L4

2017-03-11 03:54:12	BretFisher	so is it possible to see what's in your shell script?
2017-03-11 03:54:19	dragoonis	ofc
2017-03-11 03:54:31	dragoonis	So what I need now is to hijack user "node" to have a UID of 1001, so when the host gets the new files it's under the current "jenkins" user
2017-03-11 03:54:42	dragoonis	run.sh: https://gist.github.com/dragoonis/d1ead6e118e0bd590eb3fa184989cd0a
2017-03-11 03:54:44	BretFisher	I'm thinking you'd want to move most of that to a entrypoint script, including making the user, then your CMD can stay node or whatever the final command is in it

2017-03-11 04:25:46	dragoonis	it's not liking me running things as non-root
2017-03-11 04:26:48	BretFisher	yea this was what i think would have worked, you likely arrived at same: https://gist.github.com/dragoonis/d1ead6e118e0bd590eb3fa184989cd0a
2017-03-11 04:27:16	BretFisher	you're talking about things in container as non-root?
2017-03-11 04:27:28	dragoonis	just dropping to that user
2017-03-11 04:27:31	BretFisher	cus usually build tools bitch if you DO run them as root :P

2017-03-11 04:33:06	dragoonis	cool :)
2017-03-11 04:33:11	dragoonis	I tried your solution

2017-03-11 04:36:50	BretFisher	yea, sudo -u jenkins also worked for me
2017-03-11 04:36:59	BretFisher	it should take uid but guess not :0

2017-03-11 04:42:29	BretFisher	decci i don't know how you would do that with default docker... maybe with macvlan: https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-macvlan/
2017-03-11 04:42:47	BretFisher	decci --host would let container use host ip directly
2017-03-11 04:42:59	BretFisher	--ip would let you set stack ip in brigde0 network
2017-03-11 04:43:16	BretFisher	but neither would get you a new IP on subnet of host eth0
2017-03-11 04:43:29	BretFisher	but the experimental macvlan could do it

2017-03-11 07:59:43	evaluate	I'm looking into docker for deploying a couple of applications onto say 10 servers. Let's say I have 5 images/containers that I want to run on 10 different servers, all containers should run on all servers, is that possible with docker swarm easily? As far as I can tell from the documentation, swarm chooses nodes randomly on which to run the containers if I set parallelism, instead of running it "homogenuosly"...
2017-03-11 08:00:14	Tatou	Does it matter where they run?

2017-03-11 09:53:51	nemish_m	BlackMaria: ok thanks. So should I be using the UID and GID of the docker user in the docker vm for the container parameters?
2017-03-11 09:56:09	BlackMaria	iirc docker will allow containers to write any uid, but there can be hickups

2017-03-11 11:31:23	BlackMaria	So this config was from an older version of docker ( the one nemish_m from ^ is using )
2017-03-11 11:31:57	BlackMaria	I am sure that with linux you can use 127.0.0.1 but that didnt work for me here.
2017-03-11 11:33:05	Piedro	BlackMaria: seems not, in gentoo 127.0.0.1 isn't working for this image
2017-03-11 11:33:28	BlackMaria	finally the $YOUR_IP can be the 172.18 address but that would make it do you can only access it from inside docker (iiuc)

2017-03-11 12:09:50	piklu	how do I use service in swarm to publish it via various nodes on a center place?

2017-03-11 12:11:24	@programmerq	if you publish a port for a service in swarm mode, all nodes in the cluster listen and set up the "routing mesh" so traffic to any node in the cluster on that port will make it to a container that is backing the service.

2017-03-11 12:13:11	piklu	ok, so I can actually just use haproxy also within the service to achieve the same effect
2017-03-11 12:13:18	piklu	or setup one central haproxy
2017-03-11 12:13:37	piklu	and how does this compare to kubernetes, what would be the advantage to use kubernetes vs swarm

2017-03-11 12:15:22	@programmerq	piklu▸ the routing mesh feature happens using the ipvs feature in the linux kernel.
2017-03-11 12:15:45	@programmerq	you get it for free, and it makes it really easy to configure upstream ingress load balancers.

2017-03-11 12:26:15	@programmerq	it's built in to docker and super easy to get going.
2017-03-11 12:27:22	piklu	i like simplicity too
2017-03-11 12:27:23	@programmerq	the biggest issue with it in 1.12 was that it wasn't easy to use something like what you'd expect out of a docker compose file. 1.13 addad docker-compose.yml v3 support for 'docker stack deploy'
