2017-03-10 23:47:07	delevoper	If you're working in DOS, instead of git reset --soft HEAD^ you'll need to use git reset --soft HEAD~1. The ^ is a continuation character in DOS so it won't work properly. Also, --soft is the default, so you can omit it if you like and just say git reset HEAD~1.

2017-03-11 02:48:50	Rashad	Hello all. I have a deepstream server and a client. The client executes the "login" method providing the id and password: deepstream(this.connection_string).login({id, password}, callback); The authentication handler on the server receives auth={id, password} like this: function(connectionDetails, auth, server_callback) { if(auth.is.cool) server_callback(true) else server_callback(false) }
2017-03-11 02:49:11	Rashad	However, I'd like the client to receive an access token after a successful login.
2017-03-11 02:50:08	Rashad	But if I do something like: server_callback(true, token); then on the client, "callback" only receives the value of the first parameter: (either true or false) and the rest is undefined or null.

2017-03-11 06:08:23	django_	GreenJello, why was angular2 created?
2017-03-11 06:08:40	GreenJello	django_, because angular 1 is crap :-p
2017-03-11 06:08:43	django_	lol
2017-03-11 06:08:51	django_	so is angular2 not crap GreenJello ?
2017-03-11 06:09:02	GreenJello	it looks much better, but I just went through the tutorial
2017-03-11 06:09:19	GreenJello	imo it's too soon to use it on long term projects
2017-03-11 06:09:29	django_	ah
2017-03-11 06:09:34	GreenJello	give it another 6 months to mature

2017-03-11 07:30:06	GreenJello	dRealm, they behave differently from es6 import/export and the only interop between them is done by some tools but not others
2017-03-11 07:30:07	dRealm	or is there something spectacular bout these "modules.export" and "require" that I should know about?
2017-03-11 07:30:28	asteele	nothing spectacular
2017-03-11 07:30:33	GreenJello	you won't be able to use import/export on a common.js module in node or browsers; but you can with babel
2017-03-11 07:30:38	asteele	it is the node module loader you are referring to it seems
2017-03-11 07:30:41	dRealm	GreenJello, and I am sorry, I meant to say ES6
2017-03-11 07:30:43	dRealm	:p
2017-03-11 07:30:59	GreenJello	dRealm, so one difference is that with import/export essentially import variables instead of values
2017-03-11 07:31:18	GreenJello	which solves some circular dependency issues
2017-03-11 07:31:26	GreenJello	also they're completely statically analyzable
2017-03-11 07:31:53	GreenJello	vs require where you can do require(someVariable) or modify the exports object in any way you like
2017-03-11 07:31:55	dRealm	GreenJello, actually I learned in a tutorial that export actually export functions too.

2017-03-11 08:43:06	lorenzo	let output = input.map(x => x in lut ? lut[x] : x);

I'm working on a game that plays quite nicely on PC but I think it's bottle necked on mobile devices due to canvas drawing routines. I was thinking about moving my update outside of requestanimationframe in a seperate thread to avoid large timesteps due to lengthly canvas renders on mobile.

2017-03-11 14:47:19	DeltaHeavy	OverCoder If you want an ORM, use Sequelize or Bookshelf. That said I've used ORMs in Node while loving them in Python and learned...I don't like them in Node. I suggest Knex, it's a query builder.

2017-03-11 14:47:32	DeltaHeavy	Express doesn't try to do everything. It gives you a foundation for you to add things into it easily.
2017-03-11 14:47:38	ljharb	jarek: if material design doesn't look the same as the native browser, then material design is broken.

2017-03-11 14:48:07	ljharb	if you want a UI that violates browser norms, don't ship it in a browser.
2017-03-11 14:48:14	austincheney	and jarek you would have to do A LOT of accessibility work on a custom context menu that compensates for existing native features

2017-03-11 14:50:57	austincheney	jarek, if it is going to run in the browser I strongly recommend letting the browser do the things it doesn't want to assign to custom code just because there are a lot of competing considerations other than presentation.
2017-03-11 14:50:59	GreenJello	IonutVan_, yes
2017-03-11 14:51:15	GreenJello	IonutVan_, but you can upgrade the short lived token to a long lived token

2017-03-11 14:59:18	GreenJello	it gives you a user access token?
2017-03-11 14:59:22	IonutVan_	why for facebook I have to login many times and to implement the login in my app to just get a token when I can just get it from web interface by hand first time
2017-03-11 14:59:25	JustMondris	i have watched several videos on closures but i am still trying to grab it. closures give a function the ability to access variables that are outside its scopes right?

2017-03-11 15:40:02	DeltaHeavy	if statements and loops in assembly language are just comparisons and goto
2017-03-11 15:40:06	lonewaft	anyone know of any modules for implemeting something similar to the FB chat box? without all the rich media features
2017-03-11 15:40:14	Agamemnus	so when I say developed
2017-03-11 15:40:17	cjohnson	"modules" lonewaft?
2017-03-11 15:40:19	cjohnson	what do you mean
2017-03-11 15:40:21	Agamemnus	... that means back in the ES5 days
2017-03-11 15:40:22	DeltaHeavy	cmp -> jlt -> jgt -> <fallthrough>
2017-03-11 15:40:33	Agamemnus	(still now)
2017-03-11 15:40:41	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus If you can't use ES6+ obviously all you can use is var, and that's fine.
2017-03-11 15:40:50	cjohnson	I can't imagine there is a module that will implement websockets, frontend client, backend communicator, database storage, etc
2017-03-11 15:40:54	cjohnson	which piece of it are you trying to mimic
2017-03-11 15:40:55	Agamemnus	i was just looking for reasoning
2017-03-11 15:40:57	Agamemnus	that is all
2017-03-11 15:40:59	Agamemnus	thank you
2017-03-11 15:41:24	tcsc	in x86 there are instructions that do loops without explicit branching
2017-03-11 15:41:29	tcsc	well, instruction prefixes
2017-03-11 15:41:44	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus No problem!

2017-03-11 15:42:53	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus Eh, most of the stuff just runs in the background of your terminal.
2017-03-11 15:43:21	Agamemnus	so here is one issue with compiling everything.. you have to wait
2017-03-11 15:43:29	Agamemnus	that takes a bit of time if the code base is big
2017-03-11 15:43:31	Agamemnus	innit
2017-03-11 15:43:34	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus Not very long if you do it right.
2017-03-11 15:43:47	Agamemnus	okay
2017-03-11 15:43:49	DeltaHeavy	If your code base is GIGANTIC you'd run it on watch mode so it will only do cached incremental compilations.
2017-03-11 15:43:58	Agamemnus	okay
2017-03-11 15:44:00	DeltaHeavy	But you probably won't run into that problem.
2017-03-11 15:44:03	Agamemnus	i guess there are various tools
2017-03-11 15:44:12	DeltaHeavy	I have cause I'm on an...insanely...large...insanely...long running project.
2017-03-11 15:44:14	Agamemnus	i think the main issue is minification. that takes a while
2017-03-11 15:44:19	 *	austincheney is writing a diff algorithm that contains only 3 passes.  It is possible, but far more complicated than I originally thought it would be
2017-03-11 15:44:21	ES6	DeltaHeavy, you pinged me
2017-03-11 15:44:23	Agamemnus	so probably don't minify
2017-03-11 15:44:24	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus Don't do minification for your dev environment.
2017-03-11 15:44:26	Agamemnus	when testing

2017-03-11 15:44:41	Agamemnus	@ES6 lol
2017-03-11 15:44:42	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus You don't minify your code for your "dev" build.
2017-03-11 15:44:43	ES6	hue
2017-03-11 15:44:56	Agamemnus	yeah, dumb comment me
2017-03-11 15:44:59	cjohnson	Agamemnus: also your build at that point can be broken into smaller tasks
2017-03-11 15:45:07	--	ES6 is now known as OverCoder
2017-03-11 15:45:07	cjohnson	instead of always building every component, only build those ones that changed
2017-03-11 15:45:29	DeltaHeavy	Webpack is great with that due to it's code splitting capabilities...but I wouldn't bother with that stuff for a while :p
2017-03-11 15:45:47	Agamemnus	i spent about two hours trying to figure out why my minified build of my jigsaw game had an error when the unminified stuff didn't.. turns out that I had different local game settings
2017-03-11 15:45:59	Agamemnus	and one of them was buggy
2017-03-11 15:46:02	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus Are you doing variable mangling?
2017-03-11 15:46:09	DeltaHeavy	It's on by deafult with UglifyJS IIRC
2017-03-11 15:46:17	DeltaHeavy	And WILL cause issues under certain circumstances.
2017-03-11 15:46:18	Agamemnus	I was afraid it was, but it wasn't the minification.
2017-03-11 15:46:29	DeltaHeavy	What was it?
2017-03-11 15:46:29	Agamemnus	just different player settings
2017-03-11 15:46:31	DeltaHeavy	Ah
2017-03-11 15:46:43	GreenJello	that only causes problems with things that parse func.toString()
2017-03-11 15:46:44	Agamemnus	my game got overly complex. too many settings
2017-03-11 15:46:51	GreenJello	which is basically just angular 1
2017-03-11 15:46:57	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus Using a module bundler will make your code MUCH more managable.
2017-03-11 15:47:00	DeltaHeavy	eg: Webpack
2017-03-11 15:47:09	Agamemnus	hey while we are all here, so this company i am applying to has a thing
2017-03-11 15:47:22	Agamemnus	and i have no idea what it actually does... i asked before I think but I'm still not sure
2017-03-11 15:48:18	Agamemnus	https://github.com/smartprocure/directory-metagen -- so it creates directories because uhh
2017-03-11 15:48:54	Agamemnus	it creates a require js file?
2017-03-11 15:49:17	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus Looks like it creates a dependancy graph.
2017-03-11 15:49:22	lonewaft	cjohnson : none of the networking or the backend, just the frontend interface
2017-03-11 15:49:24	Agamemnus	because you can't require entire directories with require.js?

2017-03-11 15:49:43	cjohnson	the UI has nothing to do with JS
2017-03-11 15:49:57	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus You can kind of.
2017-03-11 15:50:04	Agamemnus	@cjohnson: a bit broad!
2017-03-11 15:50:19	Agamemnus	and then it uses gulp, which is obsolete, right?

2017-03-11 15:50:32	DeltaHeavy	Agamemnus Gulp is not obsolete.
2017-03-11 15:50:39	DeltaHeavy	Neither is Grunt though it's quite unpopular now.

2017-03-11 15:51:48	DeltaHeavy	Hopefully when I can finally implement Webpack, Grunt and Gulp will be phased out as we're just using them for asset building.
2017-03-11 15:51:53	cjohnson	lonewaft: browser notifications would be JS yes. for that check https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification
2017-03-11 15:51:58	Agamemnus	it runs whenever you save things?
2017-03-11 15:52:05	Agamemnus	so webpack > gulp and grunt?
