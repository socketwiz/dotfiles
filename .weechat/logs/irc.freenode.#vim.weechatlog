On windows, both registers are for the system clipboard. To use the clipboard in terminal vim, vim must be built with +clipboard

2017-03-10 20:29:06	schneid3306	Okay. Yeah I read through that on the Wiki and an SO post. I was more thinking along the lines of "here is my vimrc" and "this is my logic behind these keybindings." The ones I came up with seem a bit of a burden when I am interacting with word a lot. I have to because of a grad assignment.

2017-03-11 00:06:31	PowerPC	Would like some opinions on this
2017-03-11 00:07:11	phy1729	vi (usually vim) is available everywhere (aside from Windows), works over ssh, I find it faster and more powerful than a typical gui editor
2017-03-11 00:08:21	PowerPC	Okay
2017-03-11 00:08:29	DatseMultimedia[	It 'works differently'.  Try it, see what you think.  Generally I find myself fumbling in nano, and switch EDITOR and VISUAL to vim.
2017-03-11 00:08:32	PowerPC	That's a solid answer
2017-03-11 00:08:46	PowerPC	I got you thanks
2017-03-11 00:09:32	DatseMultimedia[	I also edit a lot of stuff over ssh, or whatever.  So GUI editors don't translate well.
2017-03-11 00:09:46	PowerPC	Makes sense
2017-03-11 00:10:23	DatseMultimedia[	Try it.  You might like it.

2017-03-11 00:10:56	phy1729	I think vim has changed the way I think about editing text, so any other editor feels wrong. vim has it's own language and you start thinking in it.
2017-03-11 00:11:16	phy1729	vimgor: peace
2017-03-11 00:11:17	vimgor	Dunno.
2017-03-11 00:11:24	phy1729	vimgor: give peace a chance
2017-03-11 00:11:25	vimgor	There is no best editor. There are only editors that fit your workflow. Don't listen to people who want you to switch to another editor, when they can't provide good reasons to do so. Don't tell others to use something, you don't have much idea about. Use whatever makes you happy.
2017-03-11 00:11:34	phy1729	Yeah not big on the evangelical front
2017-03-11 00:11:58	PowerPC	Gotcha thanks
2017-03-11 00:12:05	DatseMultimedia[	phy1729: It is a bit of an issue.  Once you get used to vim, other editors feel cumborsome.....
2017-03-11 00:12:41	phy1729	And then you start needing vim keybindings in your mail client and browser and rss reader and ...
2017-03-11 00:12:59	xall	vim ruined my life

2017-03-11 08:21:40	tstelzer	i wonder which is performing better

2017-03-11 11:46:41	robertmeta	That is from :list I think

2017-03-11 11:49:02	Murii_	thanks!
2017-03-11 11:49:09	robertmeta	Murii_: you are going to have lots more pain
2017-03-11 11:49:19	Murii_	why's that?
2017-03-11 11:49:33	Random832	Murii_, because you probably don't understand anything that's in your vimrc
2017-03-11 11:49:41	romainl	Murii_: because you are using someone else's vimrc
2017-03-11 11:49:53	osse	mr_sm1th: seems to me he just wants to write a string over multiple lines. but instead of doing just that rather write it as a comment and make a variable out of it by makeing the script read its own source code

2017-03-11 11:50:20	Murii_	The only big difference is that it has better Vundle plugins then what I had. I know how to make basic vimrc scripts :)
2017-03-11 11:50:30	Murii_	than*
2017-03-11 11:50:32	robertmeta	Murii_: list/nolist is fairly damn basic.

2017-03-11 14:30:00	cool-RR	I have a VIM question
2017-03-11 14:30:08	cool-RR	I'm using VIM to browse a directory (using netrw)
2017-03-11 14:30:17	cool-RR	But I notice it only gets invoked when I use a relative path
2017-03-11 14:30:35	cool-RR	So if I type `vim foo/bar` it explores the /foo/bar folder using netrw
2017-03-11 14:30:46	cool-RR	But if I type `vim /home/ram/foo/bar` then it fails
2017-03-11 14:30:51	cool-RR	I want it to succeed
2017-03-11 14:31:04	cool-RR	Is there a flag I can give to it to make it accept an absolute path and browse the folder using netrw

2017-03-11 15:11:33	siiky	so `:normal r` in ex (command) mode is the same as hitting r on normal mode
