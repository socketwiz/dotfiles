2017-03-11 13:16:54	endre	at first i thouhgt that you want to replace firefox itself on the fs

2017-03-11 13:17:54	endre	check your xorg log
2017-03-11 13:17:56	occultus	ishmael: you want a "$@" or something in there somewhere to pass the parameters on
2017-03-11 13:18:06	endre	hmm
2017-03-11 13:18:16	endre	sure but firefox would have been started this way as well
2017-03-11 13:18:19	ishmael	right, but even without params, it should just launch firefox when i click a link
2017-03-11 13:18:30	ishmael	and take me to my homepage
2017-03-11 13:18:40	occultus	oh, gotcha. is your script executable?
2017-03-11 13:19:08	ishmael	yes indeedy
2017-03-11 13:19:32	endre	try xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
2017-03-11 13:19:46	occultus	does "url-launcher http://fake" work from a terminal?

2017-03-11 13:23:51	ducasse	wouldn't 'i3-msg exec url-launcher' indicate if this is a path issue or not?
2017-03-11 13:25:05	ishmael	its not a path issue becuase $ url-launcher https://wikipedia.org opens my browser to the home page, as i would have expected it to behave
2017-03-11 13:25:20	ishmael	but using url-launcher how its supposed to be used doesnt do anything
2017-03-11 13:26:27	ishmael	i did xrdb -merge .Xresources and jsut regular xrdb .Xresources, closed the terminal, reopened it, still doesnt do anything
2017-03-11 13:27:18	ducasse	ishmael: from a terminal? yes, but that terminal has sourced your profile scripts where the path is set. that might not be the case for i3.
2017-03-11 13:28:10	ishmael	so how would i do it through i3?
2017-03-11 13:28:53	ducasse	try my suggestion from a few lines back.

2017-03-11 13:30:25	ducasse	ishmael: so try setting the path in .Xresources
2017-03-11 13:31:05	DaveDavenport	path in .Xresources
2017-03-11 13:31:08	DaveDavenport	?
2017-03-11 13:31:22	ishmael	ya what does that mean?
2017-03-11 13:31:55	ishmael	oh, that worked, acutally
2017-03-11 13:32:00	ishmael	i gave the full path
2017-03-11 13:34:04	ducasse	DaveDavenport: he's got a script for handling urls in urxvt set as an x resource.
2017-03-11 13:34:20	ishmael	hm, and when i put exec firefox $PATH as the line in url-launcher, the path in the address bar does not include my home directory
2017-03-11 13:35:43	ishmael	i set my path in ~/.zshrc.local
