2017-02-27 05:07:10	icebox	temhaa: really I didn't understand what is your goal... .all waits until all the promises are resolved, then the callback is executed

2017-02-27 07:35:17	Pyrrhus666	jarard01, because you iterate over the contents of listing.bar, and set the local variable foo to each value in turn
2017-02-27 07:35:52	jarard01	ok so I should expect to be able to use my AS var in this case right?
2017-02-27 07:35:55	Elarcis	jarard01: because foo is the name of the iterated item, not a variable path
2017-02-27 07:36:38	Elarcis	jarard01: you mean the name of the controller? yes
2017-02-27 07:37:33	Elarcis	jarard01: why "expect to be able", you've been using it in your example, and except the HTML errors in your template, it's working fine
2017-02-27 07:37:34	jarard01	yes, bad variable names in my example. So in my case "listing.foo in..." was what I was trying. foo in works
2017-02-27 07:38:20	Pyrrhus666	jarard01, foo is local to the loop, and has nothing to do with your controller
2017-02-27 07:38:21	Elarcis	jarard01: foo works because it's a valid variable name, while listing.foo isn't

2017-02-27 10:04:45	runtyrobot	I have a directive that is fed a number of parameters - and a content array. The directive is intended to make it easy to create relatively dynamic tables with pagination, filtering and date-ranges. I've got all of the things working - but I'd like the date ranges to be available for the service that feeds the directive. But I can't figure out how
2017-02-27 10:05:03	icebox	jarard01: anyway I don't understand your concerns... generally speaking, jquery plugins works adding and removing classes to the dom... and those classes are applied to the container of the slider

2017-02-27 10:06:41	icebox	jarard01: I am afraid you are confusing the theme and the plugin... those classes are applied to the slider
2017-02-27 10:06:53	jarard01	in relation to angluar - the classes are not applied within the ng-repeat loop

2017-02-27 10:16:01	Pyrrhus666	jarard01, as I see it : you bought some theme that uses query plugins and are trying to add angular to the mix.

And about half the time the default value is set to the "Select..." option, which is value="". It cannot be a race condition in the data of the modal, because that is already

2017-02-27 10:30:12	m0ltar	data for ng-model is loaded via injection
2017-02-27 10:30:24	m0ltar	which comes from the parent controller.
2017-02-27 10:30:44	Elarcis	m0ltar: only issue I see is that your default selected data can sometimes not be an object from the array, and ngModel takes it as invalid value
2017-02-27 10:30:47	m0ltar	think of a table row, where you click button to edit it, and the controller injects the table row
2017-02-27 10:30:54	m0ltar	cannot click the edit button if the row is not there
2017-02-27 10:31:11	Elarcis	m0ltar: do your items have a unique ID?
2017-02-27 10:31:41	m0ltar	Elarcis they have unique ID from the db with "id" attribute
2017-02-27 10:31:44	m0ltar	that's getting warm
2017-02-27 10:31:47	Elarcis	m0ltar: can you try doing something like selectedItem = items.find((item) => item.id === defaultItem.id) ?
2017-02-27 10:31:48	baako	icebox, https://plnkr.co/edit/wMAY3SBgoug7nHGPQwN1?p=preview
2017-02-27 10:31:54	m0ltar	I am cloning the object in the controller right at the top
2017-02-27 10:32:09	baako	click the add to cart its just a single button now
2017-02-27 10:32:15	m0ltar	$scope.page = {}; angular.copy(page, $scope.page);
2017-02-27 10:32:18	Elarcis	m0ltar: ngModel works by reference, if your default item is not exactly the same as the item you want to select, it won't work
2017-02-27 10:32:20	m0ltar	I do that right at the top
2017-02-27 10:32:22	icebox	baako: better
2017-02-27 10:32:31	m0ltar	Elarcis yeah i checked for that too
2017-02-27 10:32:38	Elarcis	m0ltar: dammit
2017-02-27 10:32:43	m0ltar	wait ... it has to be exact same object?
2017-02-27 10:32:44	icebox	baako: I see a blank page
2017-02-27 10:32:49	m0ltar	but why does it work half the time then???
2017-02-27 10:32:56	baako	console log icebox
2017-02-27 10:33:06	m0ltar	My options are defined like so data-ng-options="pageType.id as pageType.name for pageType in pageTypes"
2017-02-27 10:33:07	icebox	baako: blank
2017-02-27 10:33:11	m0ltar	I thought it'd be comparing id then
2017-02-27 10:33:22	baako	even when you click add to cart?
2017-02-27 10:33:23	Elarcis	m0ltar: yes it would
2017-02-27 10:33:26	baako	icebox,
2017-02-27 10:33:26	Elarcis	m0ltar: hm
2017-02-27 10:33:28	m0ltar	id in both cases is a string, for sure, which i double checked
2017-02-27 10:33:30	icebox	baako: wait
2017-02-27 10:33:40	m0ltar	no conflict of types there
2017-02-27 10:33:45	icebox	baako: ok... I am there
2017-02-27 10:33:59	icebox	baako: click and I see "Mandatory options validation: passed"
2017-02-27 10:34:03	Elarcis	m0ltar: can you try doing pageType rather than pageType.id, then adapting the code to treat the model as an object?

2017-02-27 10:34:16	heartburn	---> тут кто-нить есть из питера? <---
2017-02-27 10:34:33	m0ltar	Elarcis I have to clone the page, because I don't want to edit the original object
2017-02-27 10:34:33	Elarcis	m0ltar: I often have issues with ngOptions and item properties
2017-02-27 10:35:04	m0ltar	Elarcis ah I see what you mean.
2017-02-27 10:35:13	m0ltar	Basically create a "fake" object with just ID in it?
2017-02-27 10:35:23	m0ltar	so that ng can compare it?
2017-02-27 10:35:32	Elarcis	m0ltar: no, pageType would be the actual selected item rather than just its ID
2017-02-27 10:35:49	Elarcis	*selectable item, sorry
2017-02-27 10:36:08	m0ltar	Elarcis yeah, that's what i mean. I need to create a pageType object with id attr in it so that ng would compare to that in ng-options?
2017-02-27 10:36:20	m0ltar	then i'll have pageType in pageTypes
2017-02-27 10:36:32	Elarcis	m0ltar: what do you mean? no, just do pageType as pageType.name for pageType in pageTypes
2017-02-27 10:36:43	m0ltar	ya ya wrong syntax
2017-02-27 10:36:50	m0ltar	but the idea is the same. i need to make pageType object
2017-02-27 10:36:53	m0ltar	out of page.id
2017-02-27 10:36:58	Elarcis	m0ltar: NO.
2017-02-27 10:37:08	m0ltar	but where do I get pageType then?
2017-02-27 10:37:12	m0ltar	to compare to?
2017-02-27 10:37:15	Elarcis	m0ltar: let me show you.
2017-02-27 10:38:58	baako	icebox, it shouldnt passed it should say "failed" because the "selected"(please see JSON" is set to false
2017-02-27 10:39:19	icebox	baako: ok... did you debug it step by step?

2017-02-27 10:39:52	baako	icebox, yes I did but Elarcis pointed out that angular.ForEach doesnt do what I think
2017-02-27 10:40:16	icebox	baako: that is a good hint... did you debug the snippet?
2017-02-27 10:40:27	baako	icebox, the step by step i did shows all the right things
2017-02-27 10:40:41	icebox	baako: so it worked correctly
2017-02-27 10:41:38	Elarcis	m0ltar: have you tried to see if this makes a difference regarding your issue? https://plnkr.co/edit/gD2hhNuH3WXUqh0iU01C?p=preview
2017-02-27 10:41:55	baako	please refresh i added another console.log
2017-02-27 10:42:05	Elarcis	m0ltar: I seem to recall there are some quirks between using ngOptions, a subproperty of the repeated item as the model, and setting default values
2017-02-27 10:42:07	icebox	baako: "the step by step i did shows all the right things" means the logic is ok, you saw data is ok... so where is the bug?
2017-02-27 10:42:27	baako	found it icebox
2017-02-27 10:42:31	baako	its the foreach
2017-02-27 10:42:41	icebox	baako: as Elarcis said :)
2017-02-27 10:42:57	m0ltar	Elarcis yeah I was trying to explain that, but I didn't use the right words. that is what i was understanding you wanted me to test
2017-02-27 10:43:00	m0ltar	I will do that now. Thanks
2017-02-27 10:43:49	Elarcis	m0ltar: np
2017-02-27 10:43:59	baako	looks like i need to set a variable outside the foreach and then assign it a value Elarcis
2017-02-27 10:43:59	Elarcis	m0ltar: I have trouble understanding people myself
2017-02-27 10:44:07	baako	or is they a much better option?
2017-02-27 10:44:34	icebox	baako: try it
2017-02-27 10:45:18	icebox	off... bye

2017-02-28 03:40:06	Pyrrhus666	jarard, for CRUD like stuff, usually there´s an associated ID to use. indexes vary by order.
2017-02-28 03:40:35	jarard	so you'd have a numeric ID?
2017-02-28 03:41:01	jarard	although in my case I'm not actually deleting, only marking as inactive
2017-02-28 03:41:05	Pyrrhus666	jarard, not necessarily numeric, but unique.

2017-02-28 03:41:37	Pyrrhus666	jarard, that makes little difference, you are altering an object in a set, and usually we refer to them by ID

2017-02-28 03:42:46	jarard	so you could assign the id of the div the id of the object
2017-02-28 03:43:05	jarard	then use that to target the div
2017-02-28 03:43:36	jarard	id="foo3" etc ? where 3 is the foo.id
2017-02-28 03:43:37	Pyrrhus666	jarard, more the other way around : the objects in the set already have a (natural) id, which you assign to the delete action on rendering in the loop.

2017-02-28 04:56:41	heartburn	so, the thing about chrome extensions (as i understand it from the docs) is that they do have access to the host page's DOM, but cannot access js stuff that was created by it.
2017-02-28 04:57:53	heartburn	i'm putting together an extension that works on just one specific page, and i want reuse angular that is already included in said page.

2017-02-28 04:59:46	heartburn	basically, i'm inlining my code to make it work inside the page's context, not the extension's.
2017-02-28 05:01:20	Pyrrhus666	heartburn, if that would work, wouldn´t that open up the page to a whole lot of nasty ? (no experience at all with extensions though)
2017-02-28 05:01:48	heartburn	yea it would, but i'm the only user of that extension, so not a big deal.
2017-02-28 05:02:02	Elarcis	heartburn: why not use your JS file path as the remote URL of the script tag?
2017-02-28 05:02:04	heartburn	i just want to get some nice shortcuts in pocketcasts.
2017-02-28 05:03:11	heartburn	i don't know how to get the extension's url from within.

I have been struggling the last couple of days to get ng to build my project and no matter what I do I just cant get the dammed thing to work. So to test my sanity I setup the quick start guide, installed the cli, ran ng build and low and behond I get the same error: "Cannot read property 'config' of null" What gives?

2017-02-28 11:41:12	Embassy	It uses the quick start guide... so the recommended layout etc.

2017-02-28 11:52:41	Elarcis	Embassy: the quickstart guide is for discovering angular, it should not be used as a real working setup
2017-02-28 11:53:10	Elarcis	Embassy: I reckon this is one of my least favorite aspects of angular: they are absolutely not clear on the recommended setup, and it's non-trivial to implement and guess by oneself

2017-02-28 11:54:11	Embassy	yes
2017-02-28 11:54:56	Embassy	cant remember the command but something like: ng new app

However, when I place the @input in my base class, extend it with another class and then create a directive of the child class, I get an error that it's a unknown property.
2017-02-28 15:04:07	jancoow	Is it true that the @input doesn't work when placing it in the parent class?

2017-02-28 15:48:06	uru	Yea, just thinking about how I'd tackle that myself

2017-02-28 16:02:06	MrKeuner	Writing javascript code doesn't mean the script you execute is javascript. You write in javascript and interpret it with typescript engine. I would say this makes the executed code typescript
2017-02-28 16:02:59	TweedleDee	I won't spend time talking about transpiling, its a very simple process and you can read up on it.
2017-02-28 16:03:43	TweedleDee	its javascript you're executing
2017-02-28 16:03:45	jancoow	Just try typescript first. I never used typescript before angular 2 but it's really easy to learn with a javascript background
2017-02-28 16:04:03	jancoow	well "learn" its basicly javascript with some extras
2017-02-28 16:04:36	MrKeuner	learning is not a problem. Anybody can learn anything. Matter is to choose what to learn or not.
2017-02-28 16:04:55	jancoow	I would simply say: If you want to use angular 2, you need to learn typescript

2017-03-01 04:23:13	SargoDarya	It's cool when it works because it just adds it to everywhere you need it.
2017-03-01 04:23:32	SargoDarya	It's annoying when you forget something and it adds it to wrong stuff.
2017-03-01 04:23:38	SargoDarya	But that's a user error.

2017-03-01 04:25:44	SargoDarya	Except, it also does serving with HMR and building
2017-03-01 04:26:31	Pyrrhus666	SargoDarya, except you can also use it to add stuff to an earlier scaffolded project, which is the scary bit because it can potentially wreck everything
2017-03-01 04:26:55	SargoDarya	Yeah, that actually never worked for me that well.

2017-03-10 04:37:04	Pyrrhus666	jlebrech, on a sidenote : I only ever used this in conjunction with webpack 1 and (I think) cheap-module-source-map

2017-03-10 06:54:48	Pyrrhus666	Bent0, normally, you´d load the json in the resolve clause of the router, so it´s instantly available when rendering. ng-cloak is just for the startup of the app, not route-changes.
2017-03-10 06:55:16	Bent0	Ah ok. Im using my PHP framework to do the routing so Ill look for another way
2017-03-10 06:55:55	Pyrrhus666	Bent0, I´m talking routing in the angular app, not server side ?
2017-03-10 06:56:26	Bent0	Im not using it as a "one page app" or so, just using Angular for the GUI
2017-03-10 06:57:15	Pyrrhus666	Bent0, ah, ok. that´s not very efficient though :) also, even the default route can be delayed in a resolve, so that might work.

2017-03-10 07:42:44	SargoDarya	Just to know if I'm on the right side. Does it make sense to replace watchers with event listeners where possible and throw events instead? Should I replace filters in the DOM with computed values in the controller?
2017-03-10 07:43:28	E1arcis	SargoDarya: you're replacing an evil with another :D
2017-03-10 07:43:54	SargoDarya	Why are events a bad thing?
2017-03-10 07:44:35	E1arcis	SargoDarya: since events bubble up and down the DOM, you tie your whole workflow to the DOM structure
2017-03-10 07:44:49	SargoDarya	Nah, I meant angular events, sorry.
2017-03-10 07:45:00	E1arcis	SargoDarya: same
2017-03-10 07:45:09	SargoDarya	If I listen to the rootscope and emit them?
2017-03-10 07:45:50	SargoDarya	I think the perfect way would be to use an eventemitter like in angular
2017-03-10 07:46:00	SargoDarya	So I could bind directly to it.
2017-03-10 07:46:48	E1arcis	SargoDarya: the perfect way would be to use @Output like in Angular
2017-03-10 07:46:56	--	E1arcis is now known as Elarcis

2017-03-10 10:22:28	keka	not if it's what you like in terms of style
2017-03-10 10:22:34	Pyrrhus666	keka, it was, three years ago. now it´s not.
2017-03-10 10:22:43	E1arcis	keka: it works? then it's correct. But it's old, ugly, we have got a proper way of doing it

2017-03-10 10:24:29	Elarcis	keka: you example is basically how every single beginner learns to do angularjs because they follow super old tutorials without realizing they date from super old versions
2017-03-10 10:24:59	merpnderp	In angular 1.5 is there binding support for file input onchange events?

2017-03-10 10:25:06	merpnderp	Doensn't appear to be.
2017-03-10 10:25:26	Elarcis	merpnderp: ng-change?

When I run the application for some reason $routeProvider adds an ! infront of # in the urls, while in her computer it does not. Anyone know why it could be adding this exclamation mark in my url?

2017-03-11 06:55:26	illug	I'm setting up a new Angular 2 project and this time using JSPM. I downloaded the project from fountainjs. Webstorm editor is telling me it can not find @angular/core even though it has been downloaded to jspm_packages. I can import @angular/core to my project though and it works, so it's more of an inconvenience since I can't auto import etc. Anyone know how to fix this?

2017-03-11 07:22:19	ngm	fixl, i dont think so, specificications and guidelines, the css styles will conflict also whats the point of using material when you dont want to have material design in your app. Material design is pattern so if you are mixing some other library with it then it will coflict with the design patterns of material. So do read up about material design specifications and its advantages and pick on.
