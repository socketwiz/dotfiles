2017-03-11 06:45:01	GreenJello	dos000, make sure the <script> tag is before your bundle's script tag, and then it'll be the global variable mxClient

2017-03-11 12:01:51	Jacquie	To make it simple i got an array [0,N] and inside got [branchname,checked] where i store the boolean
2017-03-11 12:02:26	GreenJello	Jacquie, this.branches[i]['checked']: !this.branches[i]['checked']
2017-03-11 12:02:31	GreenJello	on L61
2017-03-11 12:02:57	GreenJello	Jacquie, also remove the 'i' argument on L168
2017-03-11 12:03:11	GreenJello	you want the 'i' from the .map callback
2017-03-11 12:03:49	Jacquie	The first time i noticed i couldnt modify part of the array it ll go against mutation principle then that immutable functions are not allowed in rendering so i created a method handle normal (had forgotten)
2017-03-11 12:04:04	Jacquie	Thank you GreenJello
2017-03-11 12:05:51	dannysantos	so, to a dynamic website using firebase it will be best the reactjs + react-bootstrap?
2017-03-11 12:06:00	GreenJello	yeah
2017-03-11 12:07:11	Jacquie	GreenJello on L61 i put it inside the update ?
2017-03-11 12:07:27	skinux	When Components don't get passed data, should the HTML elements within still get shown?
2017-03-11 12:07:46	GreenJello	Jacquie, does this code have a syntax error? not sure if I'm just reading it wrong
2017-03-11 12:08:18	Jacquie	on the xor operator
2017-03-11 12:08:28	GreenJello	Jacquie, oh, this isn't how the update addon is used
2017-03-11 12:08:33	Jacquie	But i dont need the update function ?
2017-03-11 12:08:48	GreenJello	you do need it, but you're trying to use it in an invalid way
2017-03-11 12:08:57	GreenJello	look over the examples for it again
2017-03-11 12:09:36	dannysantos	GreenJello: ok. I read that bootstrap is a html, css and js framework. What parts of bootstrap will i need to learn to use react-bootstrap?
2017-03-11 12:10:10	Jacquie	GreenJello Aw ok from what i understood it will recreate a copy of the array that ill reassign to my state inside setState to avoid mutations
2017-03-11 12:11:02	GreenJello	dannysantos, the grid system and just about it in general, like the variations of buttons, etc.
2017-03-11 12:11:13	GreenJello	dannysantos, the rest is react-bootstrap specific
2017-03-11 12:11:55	GreenJello	Jacquie, yeah
2017-03-11 12:12:31	GreenJello	Jacquie, you're just not passing the right arguments to the function

2017-03-11 12:12:58	Jacquie	ah and i need $set the value no?
2017-03-11 12:13:01	GreenJello	you need to pass this.state.branches as the first argument, and then an update descriptor as the second argument
2017-03-11 12:13:03	GreenJello	yeah
2017-03-11 12:13:08	GreenJello	well here you'll use $apply
2017-03-11 12:13:39	GreenJello	you could use $set, it's just more repetition

2017-03-11 15:08:28	SrPx	A friend PMed me some code which has this: `this.setState({x: 7}); console.log(this.state.x)`, and the output is 8. Under what circumstances that could happen? I'd assume the line following this.setState would always reflect the state set
2017-03-11 15:09:55	Agamemnus	you can set a getter and setter to any property
2017-03-11 15:09:58	pootpoot	setState is an asyncronous function
2017-03-11 15:10:29	Agamemnus	what is the reason for this?
2017-03-11 15:10:42	pootpoot	so updates can be batched for performance
2017-03-11 15:10:52	pootpoot	you can pass a callback after like, this.setState({x:7}, function() { console.log(this.state.x) })

2017-03-11 15:11:26	Agamemnus	the end of that tick?
2017-03-11 15:11:38	Agamemnus	somehow it figures out that the instruction chain is done?
2017-03-11 15:11:54	pootpoot	what are you trying to do
2017-03-11 15:12:20	Agamemnus	just asking questions
2017-03-11 15:12:33	SrPx	I wasn't aware it was async, thanks! I think I never tried to do something after this.setState before, it is always my last call
2017-03-11 15:13:00	pootpoot	generally you dont care WHEN states change, you just render the current state
2017-03-11 15:13:06	Agamemnus	hey, can we add local variables inside Reacy classes?
2017-03-11 15:13:09	Agamemnus	React
2017-03-11 15:13:10	SrPx	My friend was debugging something and said that was a strange behavior, I agreed and asked here. That's all I know. I let him know that this wasn't his problem
2017-03-11 15:13:18	SrPx	Thanks!
2017-03-11 15:13:41	Agamemnus	like function x () {var bleh = "bleh"..}
