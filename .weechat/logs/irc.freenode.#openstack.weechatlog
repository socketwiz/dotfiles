2017-02-26 14:03:53	jidar	as an alternative, you may not want to use cinder volumes in those stacks

2017-02-27 17:27:40	`hrdcore	hey all, I’m new to openstack and looking to deploy it on 4 servers for a development type environment.  I’ve been reading through lots of different tutorials (openstack’s, redhat’s, others) about different methods to install everything.  I’ve also considered installing everything manually to get a better understanding of all the peices.  I recently discovered the RDO project and feel like packstack or triple-o are the way to go

2017-02-28 00:19:40	jidar	TripleO is involved as it requires understanding lots of stuff, up to and including working with ironic to tag, import and boot baremetal nodes (or by using the ssh driver)
2017-02-28 00:19:52	jidar	fuel shares a bunch of the same stuff, but is mostly gui driven
2017-02-28 00:20:20	jidar	I personally deploy tripleO and have been for a few years, I quite like how you can rebuild your cloud and automate the post-deployment tasks
2017-02-28 00:20:36	RageLtMan	jidar: Is Fuel still a Mirantis project? I see in the tent now, with a v10 whereas mirantis still seems to use 9.2

2017-02-28 00:21:26	jidar	but everybody is free to contribute
2017-02-28 00:21:39	jidar	it's not surprising that HP would contribute to tripleo
2017-02-28 00:21:49	RageLtMan	Whats the difference though? Mirantis still pushing newton while upstream is ocata or something?

2017-02-28 00:22:48	jidar	both of those projects being in the tent mean that they more closely mimic the major releases
2017-02-28 00:22:56	RageLtMan	Ah
2017-02-28 00:23:04	jidar	ie: it gets tested upstream

2017-02-28 00:24:21	RageLtMan	So here's a good one - what deployment stack makes the best sense when you're deploying on hardened OS? We're aiming to build up on our hardened Arch pieces, so Fuel's image based Ubuntu/CentOS deployments dont cut it

2017-02-28 00:25:36	jidar	puppet/whatever cfm
2017-02-28 00:25:45	RageLtMan	I'm thinking Chef wrapper CBs to handle the pax issues, but leaves me a bit out with actual OS deployments on the metal.
2017-02-28 00:26:11	RageLtMan	our Razor fork is getting dusty, suppose i could go that way, unless there'a a better method now (cobbler/crowbar?)
2017-02-28 00:26:25	jidar	I wouldn't bother with the OS deployments, just deploy them how you would normally (pxe from foreman, whatever) and then provision them with whatever cfm you want
2017-02-28 00:26:44	jidar	you could try to crowbar tripleo/ironic to do that
2017-02-28 00:26:56	jidar	but that sounds like more trouble than it would be worth imho
2017-02-28 00:27:10	RageLtMan	TrippleO docs make me wonder about the sanity of its design and designers
2017-02-28 00:27:28	RageLtMan	There's something about sticking a flux capacitor into a flux capacitor that i find unnerving

2017-02-28 00:28:00	jidar	etc
2017-02-28 00:28:06	RageLtMan	The docs are detailed, technically, but a bit dry
2017-02-28 00:28:26	jidar	yea, you might want to look at the redhat docs

2017-02-28 01:31:33	KarlKloppenborg	I've run up an openstack deployment and everything is basically working but when I upload an image via Horizon it fails because the horizon dashboard is running on HTTPS but the "upload_url" returned via glance it requesting ajax upload to a http based endpoint
2017-02-28 01:31:36	KarlKloppenborg	so Chrome is blocking this
2017-02-28 01:31:54	KarlKloppenborg	Is there anything I can do to force the endpoint to upload images to be https?

2017-02-28 05:01:51	vgeorga	when I issue lxc-ls -f all of the containers have AUTOSTART value of 1 and they all belong to onboot group, is that it <egonzalez> ?
2017-02-28 05:02:38	egonzalez	vgeorga, i've not idea on OSA, but that sound like is fine

2017-02-28 05:07:17	Andrew_jedi	egonzalez: The issue was that network had to use segmentation id outside of the range defined in ml2 config
2017-02-28 05:07:56	egonzalez	Andrew_jedi, which network?
2017-02-28 05:07:59	Andrew_jedi	egonzalez: Do you have any idea why changing the cpu allocation won't have any effect?

As a result changes to the cpu_allocation_ratio are not reflected via the command line clients or the dashboard. Changes to this configuration key are only taken into account internally in the scheduler.

2017-02-28 23:10:42	h0l0l0l	i see it trying in the neutron-linuxbridge agent log, but failing with the error i mentioned

2017-03-10 08:04:29	Desdic	VAhl: the command line does support the --version but you have to look at openstacks page to see if they are newton, mitaka/whatever
2017-03-10 08:05:31	VAhl	Descdic: The problem with --version, is that will only state the component client. And not the main component. For example neutron --version will tell me 6.0.0.. But that is only the neutron client version.
