# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is an Emacs configuration rooted at `~/.emacs.d`.
- `init.el` is the entry point; it loads `bootstrap.el`, then loads each module in `modules/`.
- `modules/` contains feature-focused config (e.g., `javascript.el`, `rust.el`, `settings.el`).
- `bootstrap.el` sets up `package.el`, `use-package`, and `quelpa`.
- `custom.el` is generated by Emacs for UI/custom settings; treat it as managed output.
- `elpa/` stores installed packages.
- `snippets/` and `private/snippets/` contain yasnippet snippets.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `open -a /Applications/Emacs.app` launches the GUI app using the default config.
- `emacs -Q -l /Users/rickynelson/.emacs.d/init.el` runs Emacs with only this config.
- `emacs --debug-init -l /Users/rickynelson/.emacs.d/init.el` enables backtraces for startup failures.
- In Emacs: `M-x package-refresh-contents` refreshes package metadata, `M-x package-upgrade` upgrades packages.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Emacs Lisp indentation defaults (2 spaces, no tabs).
- Module files are noun/feature named (e.g., `shell.el`, `packages.el`).
- Prefer `use-package` blocks to keep package config localized and readable.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated tests are defined for this repository.
- Validate changes by launching Emacs with `-Q` and verifying the affected feature.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history exists in the bare repo at `~/.dotfiles`; recent messages are short, imperative phrases.
- Use concise, action-oriented commit subjects (e.g., "Add rust tooling defaults").
- PRs should explain user-visible changes and include repro/verification steps; screenshots only for UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Put machine-specific or secret values in `private/` or `custom.el`, not in shared modules.
- Avoid committing `elpa/` and other generated directories unless intentionally vendoring.
