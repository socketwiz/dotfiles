Shows the current line number on the active line.\n\n## Supports vim-mode\n\nIn [vim-mode](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode)'s insert mode, line numbers will automatically revert back to absolute.\n\n## Customization\n\n### Change current line color\n\nTo change the color for the currently highlighted line, put the following in your stylesheet.\n\n``` less\natom-text-editor::shadow .relative.current-line {\n  color: purple\n}\n```\n\n### Show both absolute and relative numbers\n\nThe absolute line numbers are still there, they're just invisible. Put this in your stylesheet to always show them:\n\n``` less\natom-text-editor::shadow .absolute {\n  display: inline;\n  opacity: 0.5;\n  padding-right: 1em;\n}\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/justmoon/relative-numbers/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/justmoon/relative-numbers#readme","_id":"relative-numbers@0.3.1","_shasum":"26bd39477ec712bec2cbd6d32a64d21860d2ee0c","_resolved":"file:../d-1151129-5085-e98obr/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151129-5085-e98obr/package.tgz"}
